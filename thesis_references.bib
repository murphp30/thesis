abstract = {Parker Solar Probe (PSP) achieved its first orbit perihelion on November 6, 2018, reaching a heliocentric distance of about 0.165 au (35.55 R{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}). Here, we study the evolution of fully developed turbulence associated with the slow solar wind along the PSP trajectory between 35.55 R{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and 131.64 R{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} in the outbound direction, comparing observations to a theoretical turbulence transport model. Several turbulent quantities, such as the fluctuating kinetic energy and the corresponding correlation length, the variance of density fluctuations, and the solar wind proton temperature are determined from the PSP SWEAP plasma data along its trajectory between 35.55 R{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and 131.64 R{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. The evolution of the PSP derived turbulent quantities are compared to the numerical solutions of the nearly incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (NI MHD) turbulence transport model recently developed by Zank et al. (2017). We find reasonable agreement between the theoretical and observed results. On the basis of these comparisons, we derive other theoretical turbulent quantities, such as the energy in forward and backward propagating modes, the total turbulent energy, the normalized residual energy and cross-helicity, the fluctuating magnetic energy, and the correlation lengths corresponding to forward and backward propagating modes, the residual energy, and the fluctuating magnetic energy.},

abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio transients originating from sources at extragalactic distances1, the origin of which is unknown. Some FRB sources emit repeat bursts, ruling out cataclysmic origins for those events2–4. Despite searches for periodicity in repeat burst arrival times on timescales from milliseconds to many days2,5–7, these bursts have hitherto been observed to appear sporadically and—although clustered8—without a regular pattern. Here we report observations of a 16.35 ± 0.15 day periodicity (or possibly a higher-frequency alias of that periodicity) from the repeating FRB 180916.J0158+65 detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst Project4,9. In 38 bursts recorded from 16 September 2018 to 4 February 2020 utc, we find that all bursts arrive in a five-day phase window, and 50 per cent of the bursts arrive in a 0.6-day phase window. Our results suggest a mechanism for periodic modulation either of the burst emission itself or through external amplification or absorption, and disfavour models invoking purely sporadic processes.},

abstract = {The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) is a novel transit radio telescope operating across the 400-800-MHz band. CHIME is comprised of four 20-m x 100-m semi-cylindrical paraboloid reflectors, each of which has 256 dual-polarization feeds suspended along its axis, giving it a {\textgreater}200 square degree field-of-view. This, combined with wide bandwidth, high sensitivity, and a powerful correlator makes CHIME an excellent instrument for the detection of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The CHIME Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB) will search beam-formed, high time-and frequency-resolution data in real time for FRBs in the CHIME field-of-view. Here we describe the CHIME/FRB backend, including the real-time FRB search and detection software pipeline as well as the planned offline analyses. We estimate a CHIME/FRB detection rate of 2-42 FRBs/sky/day normalizing to the rate estimated at 1.4-GHz by Vander Wiel et al. (2016). Likely science outcomes of CHIME/FRB are also discussed. CHIME/FRB is currently operational in a commissioning phase, with science operations expected to commence in the latter half of 2018.},

abstract = {We present Very Large Array observations at wavelengths of 2, 3.5, 6, and 20 cm, of angular broadening of radio sources due to the solar wind in the region 2-16 solar radii. Angular broadening is anisotropic with axial ratios in the range 2-16. Larger axial ratios are observed preferentially at smaller solar distances. Assuming that anisotropy is due to scattering blobs elongated along magnetic field lines, the distribution of position angles of the elliptically broadened images indicates that the field lines are non-radial even at the largest heliocentric distances observed here. At 5R⊙, the major axis scattering angle is ∼ 0.7" at $\lambda$= 6 cm and it varies with heliocentric distance as R-1.6. The level of turbulence, characterized by the wave structure function at a scale of 10 km along the major axis, normalized to $\lambda$ = 20 cm, has a value 20 ± 7 at 5R⊙and varies with heliocentric distance as R-3. Comparison with earlier resu lts suggest that the level of turbulence is higher during solar maximum. Assuming a power-law spectrum of electron density fluctuations, the fitted spectral exponents have values in the range 2.8-3.4 for scale sizes between 2-35 km. The data suggests temporal fluctuations (of up to 10{\%}) in the spectral exponent on a time scale of a few tens of minutes. The observed structure functions at different solar distances do not show any evidence for an inner scale; the upper limits are l k m at 2 R⊙ and 4 km at 13 R⊙. These upper limits are in conflict with earlier determinations and may suggest a reduced inner scale during solar maximum. {\textcopyright} 1994 Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {We present an implementation of the coherent dedispersion algorithm capable of dedispersing high-time-resolution radio observations to many different dispersion measures (DMs). This approach allows the removal of the dispersive effects of the interstellar medium and enables searches for pulsed emission from pulsars and other millisecond-duration transients at low observing frequencies and/or high DMs where time broadening of the signal due to dispersive smearing would otherwise severely reduce the sensitivity. The implementation, called cdmt, for coherent dispersion measure trials, exploits the parallel processing capability of general-purpose graphics processing units to accelerate the computations. We describe the coherent dedispersion algorithm and detail how cdmt implements the algorithm to efficiently compute many coherent DM trials. We apply the concept of a semi-coherent dedispersion search, where coherently dedispersed trials at coarsely separated DMs are subsequently incoherently dedispersed at finer steps in DM. The software is used in an ongoing LOFAR pilot survey to test the feasibility of performing semi-coherent dedispersion searches for millisecond pulsars at 135 MHz. This pilot survey has led to the discovery of a radio millisecond pulsar—the first at these low frequencies. This is the first time that such a broad and comprehensive search in DM-space has been done using coherent dedispersion, and we argue that future low-frequency pulsar searches using this approach are both scientifically compelling and feasible. Finally, we compare the performance of cdmt with other available alternatives.},

abstract = {Multipath propagation in the interstellar medium distorts radio pulses, an effect predominant for distant pulsars observed at low frequencies. Typically, broadened pulses are analyzed to determine the amount of propagation-induced pulse broadening, but with little interest in determining the undistorted pulse shapes. In this paper we develop and apply a method that recovers both the intrinsic pulse shape and the pulse broadening function that describes the scattering of an impulse. The method resembles the CLEAN algorithm used in synthesis imaging applications, although we search for the best pulse broadening function, and perform a true deconvolution to recover intrinsic pulse structre. As figures of merit to optimize the deconvolution, we use the positivity and symmetry of the deconvolved result along with the mean square residual and the number of points below a given threshold. Our method makes no prior assumptions about the intrinsic pulse shape and can be used for a range of scattering functions for the interstellar medium. It can therefore be applied to a wider variety of measured pulse shapes and degrees of scattering than the previous approaches. We apply the technique to both simulated data and data from Arecibo observations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. Electromagnetic wave scattering off density inhomogeneities in the solar corona is an important process that determines both the apparent source size and the time profile of radio bursts observed at 1 au. Here we model the scattering process using a Fokker-Planck equation and apply this formalism to several regimes of interest. In the first regime the density fluctuations are considered quasi-static and diffusion in wavevector space is dominated by angular diffusion on the surface of a constant energy sphere. In the small-angle ("pencil-beam") approximation, this diffusion further occurs over a small solid angle in wavevector space. The second regime corresponds to a much later time, by which scattering has rendered the photon distribution near-isotropic, resulting in a spatial diffusion of the radiation. The third regime involves time-dependent fluctuations and, therefore, Fermi acceleration of photons. Combined, these results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework within which to understand several important features of propagation of radio burst waves in the solar corona: emitted photons are accelerated in a relatively small inner region and then diffuse outward to larger distances. En route, angular diffusion results both in source sizes that are substantially larger than the intrinsic source and in observed intensity-versus-time profiles that are asymmetric, with a sharp rise and an exponential decay. Both of these features are consistent with observations of solar radio bursts.},

abstract = {We present broadband, low-frequency (25-80? MHz and 110-190? MHz) LOFAR observations of PSR B0943+10, with the goal of better illuminating the nature of its enigmatic mode-switching behaviour. This pulsar shows two relatively stable states: a "bright" (B) and "quiet" (Q) mode, each with different characteristic brightness, profile morphology, and single-pulse properties. We model the average profile evolution both in frequency and time from the onset of each mode, and highlight the differences between the two modes. In both modes, the profile evolution can be explained well by radius-to-frequency mapping at altitudes within a few hundred kilometres of the stellar surface. If both B and Q-mode emissions originate at the same magnetic latitude, then we find that the change of emission height between the modes is less than 6{\%}. We also find that, during B-mode, the average profile is gradually shifting towards later spin phase and then resets its position at the next Q-to-B transition. The observed B-mode profile delay is frequency-independent (at least from 25-80? MHz) and asymptotically changes towards a stable value of about 4 × 10-3 in spin phase by the end of mode instance, so much too high to be due to a changing spin-down rate. Such a delay can be interpreted as a gradual movement of the emission cone against the pulsar's direction of rotation, with different field lines being illuminated over time. Another interesting explanation is a possible variation in the accelerating potential inside the polar gap. This explanation connects the observed profile delay to the gradually evolving subpulse drift rate, which depends on the gradient of the potential across the field lines.},

abstract = {The ratio of the rms electron density fluctuations to the background density in the solar wind (density modulation index, $\epsilon$N ≡ $\Delta$N/N) is of vital importance for understanding several problems in heliospheric physics related to solar wind turbulence. In this paper, we have investigated the behavior of $\epsilon$N in the inner heliosphere from 0.26 to 0.82 AU. The density fluctuations $\Delta$N have been deduced using extensive ground-based observations of interplanetary scintillation at 327 MHz, which probe spatial scales of a few hundred kilometers. The background densities (N) have been derived using near-Earth observations from the Advanced Composition Explorer. Our analysis reveals that 0.001 ≲ $\epsilon$N ≲ 0.02 and does not vary appreciably with heliocentric distance. We also find that $\epsilon$N declines by 8{\%} from 1998 to 2008. We discuss the impact of these findings on problems ranging from our understanding of Forbush decreases to the behavior of the solar wind dynamic pressure over the recent peculiar solar minimum at the end of cycle 23.},

abstract = {The pulsar's signal passes through the interstellar medium (ISM) which leads to both chromatic dispersive delays and multipath pulse broadening. These effects have a strong frequency dependence (f −2 and f −4 respectively). Pulse profiles of pulsars are also frequency-dependent leading to some degeneracy with the ISM imprint. Furthermore, many pulsars show a turnover of their spectrum around {\~{}}100 MHz. For all these reasons, the frequency band below 100 MHz contains a lot of information about both the pulsar emission and the ISM. Our study is based on a LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) monitoring campaign using the international station FR606. Firstly, we demonstrate the importance of a monitoring campaign. Secondly, we calculate median spectra and locate the turnover frequency for 3 pulsars (B0809+74, B1133+16, B1508+55).},

In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a GPU-based correlator and beamformer with the same capabilities as the Blue Gene based systems. We focus on the design approach taken, and show the challenges faced in selecting an appropriate system. The design, implementation and verification of the software system shows the value of a modern test-driven development approach.

abstract = {Type II and III solar radio bursts are associated with shock waves and streams of energetic electrons, respectively, which drive plasma waves and radio emission at multiples of the electron plasma frequency as they move out from the corona into the interplanetary medium. Analogous plasma waves and radiation are observed from the foreshock region upstream of Earth's bow shock. In situ spacecraft observations in the solar wind have enabled major progress to be made in developing quantitative theories for these phenomena that are consistent with available data. Similar processes are believed responsible for radio emissions at 2–3 kHz that originate in the distant heliosphere, from where the solar wind interacts with the local interstellar medium. The primary goal of this paper is to review the observations and theories for these four classes of emissions, focusing on recent progress in developing detailed theories for the plasma waves and radiation in the source regions. The secondary goal is to introduce and review stochastic growth theory, a recent theory which appears quantitatively able to explain the wave observations in type III bursts and Earth's foreshock and is a natural theory to apply to type II bursts, the outer heliospheric emissions, and perhaps astrophysicalemissions.},

The instrument operates in the frequency range of {\~{}}10–240 MHz and is used for a variety of astrophysical science cases. While it is not heliophysics or space weather dedicated, a new project entitled “LOFAR for Space Weather” (LOFAR4SW) aims at designing a system upgrade to allow the entire array to observe the Sun, heliosphere, Earth's ionosphere, and Jupiter throughout its observing window. This will allow the instrument to operate as a space weather observing platform, facilitating both space weather science and operations. Part of this design study aims to survey the existing space weather infrastructure operating at radio frequencies and show how LOFAR4SW can advance the current state-of-the-art in this field. In this paper, we survey radio instrumentation and facilities that currently operate in space weather science and/or operations, including instruments involved in solar, heliospheric, and ionospheric studies. We furthermore include an overview of the major space weather service providers in operation today and the current state-of-the-art in the radio data they use and provide routinely.

abstract = {Solar flares often involve the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies and the generation of high-intensity bursts of radio emission. In some cases, the radio bursts can show periodic or quasiperiodic intensity pulsations. However, precisely how these pulsations are generated is still subject to debate. Prominent theories employ mechanisms such as periodic magnetic reconnection, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations, or some combination of both. Here we report on high-cadence (0.25 s) radio imaging of a 228 MHz radio source pulsating with a period of 2.3 s during a solar flare on 2014-April-18. The pulsating source is due to an MHD sausage mode oscillation periodically triggering electron acceleration in the corona. The periodic electron acceleration results in the modulation of a loss-cone instability, ultimately resulting in pulsating plasma emission. The results show that a complex combination of MHD oscillations and plasma instability modulation can lead to pulsating radio emission in astrophysical environments.},

abstract = {Cosmic rays and solar energetic particles may be accelerated to relativistic energies by shock waves in astrophysical plasmas. On the Sun, shocks and particle acceleration are often associated with the eruption of magnetized plasmoids, called coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, the physical relationship between CMEs and shock particle acceleration is not well understood. Here, we use extreme ultraviolet, radio and white-light imaging of a solar eruptive event on 22 September 2011 to show that a CME-induced shock (Alfv{\'{e}}n Mach number 2.4 +0.7-0.8 ) was coincident with a coronal wave and an intense metric radio burst generated by intermittent acceleration of electrons to kinetic energies of 2-46 keV (0.1-0.4 c). Our observations show that plasmoid-driven quasiperpendicular shocks are capable of producing quasiperiodic acceleration of electrons, an effect consistent with a turbulent or rippled plasma shock surface. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {The radio signature of a shock travelling through the solar corona is known as a type II solar radio burst. In rare cases these bursts can exhibit a fine structure known as "herringbones", which are a direct indicator of particle acceleration occurring at the shock front. However, few studies have been performed on herringbones and the details of the underlying particle acceleration processes are unknown. Here, we use an image processing technique known as the Hough transform to statistically analyse the herringbone fine structure in a radio burst at ∼20-90 MHz observed from the Rosse Solar-Terrestrial Observatory on 2011 September 22. We identify 188 individual bursts which are signatures of bi-directional electron beams continuously accelerated to speeds of 0.16-0.10+0.11c. This occurs at a shock acceleration site initially at a constant altitude of ∼0.6 R⊙ in the corona, followed by a shift to ∼0.5 R⊙. The anti-sunward beams travel a distance of 170-97+174 Mm (and possibly further) away from the acceleration site, while those travelling toward the Sun come to a stop sooner, reaching a smaller distance of 112-76+84 Mm. We show that the stopping distance for the sunward beams may depend on the total number density and the velocity of the beam. Our study concludes that a detailed statistical analysis of herringbone fine structure can provide information on the physical properties of the corona which lead to these relatively rare radio bursts.},

abstract = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions of plasma and magnetic field from the low solar corona into the heliosphere. These eruptions are often associated with energetic electrons that produce various kinds of radio emission. However, there is ongoing investigation into exactly where, when, and how the electron acceleration occurs during flaring and eruption, and how the associated radio emission can be exploited as a diagnostic of both particle acceleration and CME eruptive physics. Here, we review past and present developments in radio observations of flaring and eruption, from the destabilization of flux ropes to the development of a CME and the eventual driving of shocks in the corona. We concentrate primarily on the progress made in CME radio physics in the past two decades and show how radio imaging spectroscopy provides the ability to diagnose the locations and kinds of electron acceleration during eruption, which provides insight into CME eruptive models in the early stages of their evolution ({\textless} 10 R ⊙). We finally discuss how new instrumentation in the radio domain will pave the way for a deeper understanding of CME physics in the near future.},

These deconvolution algorithms find an estimate of the true sky brightness from the necessarily incomplete sampled visibility data. The most widely used radio synthesis deconvolution method is the CLEAN algorithm of H{\"{o}}gbom. This algorithm works extremely well for collections of point sources and surprisingly well for extended objects. However, the performance for extended objects can be improved by adopting a multiscale approach. We describe and demonstrate a conceptually simple and algorithmically straightforward extension to CLEAN that models the sky brightness by the summation of components of emission having different size scales. While previous multiscale algorithms work sequentially on decreasing scale sizes, our algorithm works simultaneously on a range of specified scales. Applications to both real and simulated data sets are given. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be an ultrasensitive radio telescope, built to further the understanding of the most important phenomena in the Universe, including some pertaining to the birth and eventual death of the Universe itself. Over the next few years, the SKA will make the transition from an early formative to a well-defined design. This paper outlines how the scientific challenges are translated into technical challenges, how the application of recent technology offers the potential of affordably meeting these challenges, and how the choices of technology will ultimately be made. The SKA will be an array of coherently connected antennas spread over an area about 3000 km in extent, with an aggregate antenna collecting area of up to 106 m {\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} at centimeter and meter wavelengths. A key scientific requirement is the ability to carry out sensitive observations of the sky over large areas (surveys). The survey speed of the SKA will be enabled by the application of the most up-to-date signal-processing technology available. The SKA science impact will be widely felt in astroparticle physics and cosmology, fundamental physics, galactic and extragalactic astronomy, solar system science, and astrobiology. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Context. High-precision pulsar-timing experiments are affected by temporal variations of the dispersion measure (DM), which are related to spatial variations in the interstellar electron content and the varying line of sight to the source. Correcting for DM variations relies on the cold-plasma dispersion law which states that the dispersive delay varies with the squared inverse of the observing frequency. This may, however, give incorrect measurements if the probed electron content (and therefore the DM) varies with observing frequency, as is predicted theoretically due to the different refraction angles at different frequencies.},

abstract = {We report on Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope observations of the Crab pulsar at 350 MHz from 2012 November 24 until 2015 June 21. During this period we consistently observe variations in the pulse profile of the Crab. Both variations in the scattering width of the pulse profile as well as delayed copies, also known as echoes, are seen regularly. These observations support the classification of two types of echoes: those that follow the truncated exponential shape expected for the thin-screen scattering approximation, and echoes that show a smoother, more Gaussian shape. During a sequence of high-cadence observations in 2015, we find that these non-exponential echoes evolve in time by approaching the main pulse and interpulse in phase, overlapping the main pulse and interpulse, and later receding. We find a pulse scatter-broadening time-scale, $\tau$, scaling with frequency as $\nu$$\alpha$, with $\alpha$ = −3.9 ± 0.5, which is consistent with expected values for thin-screen scattering models.},

abstract = {Space weather describes the way in which the Sun, and conditions in space more generally, impact human activity and technology both in space and on the ground. It is now well understood that space weather represents a significant threat to infrastructure resilience, and is a source of risk that is wide-ranging in its impact and the pathways by which this impact may occur. Although space weather is growing rapidly as a field, work rigorously assessing the overall economic cost of space weather appears to be in its infancy. Here, we provide an initial literature review to gather and assess the quality of any published assessments of space weather impacts and socioeconomic studies. Generally speaking, there is a good volume of scientific peer-reviewed literature detailing the likelihood and statistics of different types of space weather phenomena. These phenomena all typically exhibit “power-law” behavior in their severity. The literature on documented impacts is not as extensive, with many case studies, but few statistical studies. The literature on the economic impacts of space weather is rather sparse and not as well developed when compared to the other sections, most probably due to the somewhat limited data that are available from end-users. The major risk is attached to power distribution systems and there is disagreement as to the severity of the technological footprint. This strongly controls the economic impact. Consequently, urgent work is required to better quantify the risk of future space weather events.},

Observations were made over 1.1−1.9 GHz (L band), with three sets of five-minute observations of the 692 primary targets, interspersed with five-minute observations of secondary targets. By comparing the “ON” and “OFF” observations we are able to identify terrestrial interference and place limits on the presence of engineered signals from putative extraterrestrial civilizations inhabiting the environs of the target stars. During the analysis, eleven events passed our thresholding algorithm, but a detailed analysis of their properties indicates they are consistent with known examples of anthropogenic radio frequency interference. We conclude that, at the time of our observations, none of the observed systems host high-duty-cycle radio transmitters emitting between 1.1 and 1.9 GHz with an Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power of ∼ 1013 W, which is readily achievable by our own civilization. Our results suggest that fewer than ∼ 0.1{\%} of the stellar systems within 50 pc possess the type of transmitters searched in this survey.},

During the last 20 years most theoretical work has concentrated on models which store magnetic energy in the corona in the form of electrical currents, and a major goal of present day research is to understand how these currents are created, and then later dissipated during a flare. Another important goal is to find a flare model which can eject magnetic flux into interplanetary space. Although many flares do not eject magnetic flux, those which do are of special importance for solar-terrestrial relations since the ejected flux can have dramatic effects if it hits the Earth's magnetosphere. Three flare models which have been extensively investigated are the emerging-flux model, the sheared-arcade model, and the magnetic-flux-rope model. All of these models can store and release magnetic energy efficiently provided that rapid magnetic reconnection occurs. However, only the magne...},

Understanding these fundamental phenomena has been a top-priority science goal for over five decades, dating back to the 1958 Simpson Committee Report. The scale and concept of such a mission has been revised at intervals since that time, yet the core has always been a close encounter with the Sun. The mission design and the technology and engineering developments enable SPP to meet its science objectives to: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The SPP mission was confirmed in March 2014 and is under development as a part of NASA's Living with a Star (LWS) Program. SPP is scheduled for launch in mid-2018, and will perform 24 orbits over a 7-year nominal mission duration. Seven Venus gravity assists gradually reduce SPP's perihelion from 35 solar radii (RS) for the first orbit to {\textless}10RS for the final three orbits.

abstract = {We measure the effects of interstellar scattering on average pulse profiles from 13 radio pulsars with simple pulse shapes. We use data from the LOFAR High Band Antennas, at frequencies between 110 and 190 MHz.We apply a forward fitting technique, and simultaneously determine the intrinsic pulse shape, assuming single Gaussian component profiles. We find that the constant $\tau$ , associated with scattering by a single thin screen, has a power-law dependence on frequency $\tau$ ∝ $\nu$ -a, with indices ranging from $\alpha$ = 1.50 to 4.0, despite simplest theoretical models predicting $\alpha$ =4.0 or 4.4. Modelling the screen as an isotropic or extremely anisotropic scatterer, we find anisotropic scattering fits lead to larger power-law indices, often in better agreement with theoretically expected values.We compare the scattering models based on the inferred, frequency-dependent parameters of the intrinsic pulse, and the resulting correction to the dispersion measure (DM). We highlight the cases in which fits of extreme anisotropic scattering are appealing, while stressing that the data do not strictly favour either model for any of the 13 pulsars. The pulsars show anomalous scattering properties that are consistent with finite scattering screens and/or anisotropy, but these data alone do not provide the means for an unambiguous characterization of the screens. We revisit the empirical t versus DM relation and consider how our results support a frequency dependence of a. Very long baseline interferometry, and observations of the scattering and scintillation properties of these sources at higher frequencies, will provide further evidence.},

abstract = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale magnetized plasma structures ejected from closed magnetic field regions of the Sun. White light coronagraphic observations from ground and space have provided extensive information on CMEs in the outer corona. However, our understanding of the solar origin and early life of CMEs is still in an elementary stage because of lack of adequate observations. Recent space missions such as Yohkoh and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and ground-based radioheliographs at Nobeyama and Nancay have accumulated a wealth of information on the manifestations of CMEs near the solar surface. We review some of these observations in an attempt to relate them to what we already know about CMEs. Our discussion relies heavily on non-coronagraphic data combined with coronagraphic data. Specifically, we discuss the following aspects of CMEs: (i) coronal dimming and global disk signatures, (ii) non-radial propagation during the early phase, (iii) Photospheric magnetic field changes during CMEs, and (iv) acceleration of fast CMEs. The relative positions and evolution of coronal dimming, arcade formation, prominence eruption will be discussed using specific events. The magnitude and spatial extent of CME acceleration may be an important parameter that distinguishes fast and slow CMEs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019. The American Astronomical Society.. Low-frequency radio observations make it possible to study the solar corona at distances up to 2-3 R. Frequency of plasma emission is a proxy for electron density of the emitting plasma and, therefore, observations of solar radio bursts can be used to probe the density structure of the outer corona. In this study, positions of solar radio sources are investigated using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) spectral imaging in the frequency range 30-50 MHz. We show that there are events where apparent positions of the radio sources cannot be explained using the standard coronal density models. Namely, the apparent heliocentric positions of the sources are 0.1-0.7 R further from the Sun compared with the positions predicted by the Newkirk model, and these shifts are frequency-dependent. We discuss several possible explanations for this effect, including enhanced plasma density in the flaring corona, as well as scattering and refraction of the radio waves.},

abstract = {A hardware real-time coherent dedispersion filter based on the Reticon 5601A Quad Chirped Transversal Filter is shown to be effective for time-resolution improvement of pulsar measurements. The filter can completely remove the time distortion due to dispersive propagation through the interstellar medium. The maximum bandwidth of the filter is greater than 2 MHz, which yields an ultimate time resolution of about 0.5 $\mu$s. The immunity of such a filter to arrival time shifts due to interstellar scintillation spectral modulation makes it particularly useful for precision time of arrival measurements of the millisecond pulsar PSR 1937 + 214. Integrated into a system for synoptic pulsar measurements, the filter will allow us to improve the precision of extended time interval measurements beyond the current atomic standards, which, in turn, may allow setting of new limits on the existence of gravitational radiation and improve the precision of the solar system ephemeris. The principles of operation, the required support circuitry, and the results of simulations and actual telescope operation are described.},

During the B mode we detected PSR B0823+26 in 0.2-2 keV X-rays and discovered pulsed emission with a broad sinusoidal pulse, lagging the radio main pulse by 0.208 ± 0.012 in phase, with high pulsed fraction of 70 - 80 per cent. During the Q mode PSR B0823+26 was not detected in X-rays (2s upper limit a factor {\~{}}9 below the B-mode flux). The total X-ray spectrum, pulse profile and pulsed fraction can globally be reproduced with a magnetized partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere model with three emission components: a primary small hotspot (T {\~{}} 3.6 × 106 K, R {\~{}}17 m), a larger cooler concentric ring (T {\~{}} 1.1 × 106 K, R {\~{}}280 m) and an antipodal hotspot (T{\~{}}1.1×106 K, R{\~{}}100 m), for the angle between the rotation axis and line of sight direction{\~{}}66°. The latter is in conflict with the radio derived value of (84±0.7)°. The average X-ray flux within hours-long B-mode intervals varied by a factor±20 per cent, possibly correlated with variations in the frequency and lengths of short radio nulls or short durations of weak emission. The correlated X-ray/radio moding of PSR B0823+26 is compared with the anti-correlated moding of PSR B0943+10, and the lack of X-ray moding of PSR B1822-09. We speculate that the X-ray/radio switches of PSR B0823+26 are due to variations in the rate of accretion of material from the interstellar medium through which it is passing.},

abstract = {Jupiter's radio emissions are dominated in intensity by decametric radio emissions due to the Io-Jupiter interaction. A significant part of these emissions consists of short radio bursts (so-called S-bursts) drifting in time and frequency. Previous analyses suggest that these emissions are cyclotron-maser emissions in the flux tube connecting Io or Io's wake to Jupiter. We present simulations of these electrons under the assumption of acceleration by Alfv{\'{e}}n waves in the Io flux tube. Near Jupiter, a loss cone and a ring distribution appear in the magnetically mirrored electron population, which can then amplify extraordinary (X) mode radio waves. The X-mode growth rate is computed, which allows us to build theoretical dynamic spectra of the resulting Jovian radio emissions. Additional potential structures are assumed in the Jovian auroral region. We reconstruct their impact on the morphology of the emission. They match some of the time-frequency patterns observed with Jovian S-bursts. This provides the first evidence of bipolar electrostatic structures in the Jovian auroral region.

abstract = {Jovian millisecond (or S-) bursts are intense impulsive decametric radio bursts drifting in frequency in tens of milliseconds. Most of the theories about their origin comprise an interpretation of their frequency drift. Previous analyses suggest that S-bursts are cyclotron-maser emission in the flux tubes connecting Io or Io's wake to Jupiter. Electrons are thought to be accelerated from Io to Jupiter. Near Jupiter, a loss cone appears in the magnetically mirrored electron population, which is able to amplify extraordinary (X) mode radio waves. Here, we perform an automated analysis of 230 high-resolution dynamic spectra of S-bursts, providing 5 × 106 frequency drift measurements. Our data are consistent with the above scenario. In addition, we confirm over a large number of measurements that the frequency drift d f / d t (f) is in average negative and decreases (in absolute value) at high frequencies, as predicted by the adiabatic theory. We find a typical energy of 4 keV for the emitting electrons. In 15{\%} of the cases (out of 230), we find for the first time evidence of localized ∼ 1 keV electric potential jumps at high latitudes along the field lines connecting Io or Io's wake to Jupiter. These potential jumps appear stable over tens of minutes. Finally, a statistical analysis suggests the existence of a distributed parallel acceleration of the emitting electrons along the same field lines. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Both of these projects utilise a modular, object-oriented design philosophy. psrchive is an open source development environment that incorporates an extensive range of c ++ object classes and pre-built command line and graphical utilities. These deal transparently and simultaneously with multiple data storage formats, thereby enhancing data portability and facilitating the adoption of the psrfits file format. Here, data are stored in a series of modular header–data units that provide flexibility and scope for future expansion. As it is based on FITS, various standard libraries and applications may be used for data input, output, and visualisation.

Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers.

This provides students with a stronger understanding of the topics covered, their interconnections, and when different types of plasma models are applicable. Furthermore, mathematical derivations are rigorous, yet concise, so physical understanding is not lost in lengthy mathematical treatments. Worked examples illustrate practical applications of theory and students can test their new knowledge with 90 end-of-chapter problems.},

abstract = {The amplitude of density turbulence in the extended solar corona, especially near the dissipation scale, impinges on several problems of current interest. Radio sources observed through the turbulent solar wind are broadened due to refraction by and scattering off density inhomogeneities, and observations of scatter broadening are often employed to constrain the turbulence amplitude. The extent of such scatter broadening is usually computed using the structure function, which gives ameasure of the spatial correlationmeasured by an interferometer. Most such treatments have employed analytical approximations to the structure function that are valid in the asymptotic limits s ≫ li or s ≪ li, where s is the interferometer spacing and li is the inner scale of the density turbulence spectrum. We instead use a general structure function (GSF) that straddles these regimes, and quantify the errors introduced by the use of these approximations.We have included the effects of anisotropic scattering for distant cosmic sources viewed through the solar wind at small elongations. We show that the regimes where the GSF predictions are more accurate than those of the asymptotic expressions are not only of practical relevance, but are where inner scale effects influence estimates of scatter broadening. Taken together, we argue that the GSF should henceforth be used for scatter broadening calculations and estimates of turbulence amplitudes in the solar corona and solar wind.},

We chose the 60 nearest stars, all within 5.1 pc from the Sun. Such nearby stars offer the potential to observe faint radio signals from transmitters that have a power similar to those on Earth. We add a list of 1649 stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalog that span the Hertzprung-Russell diagram, including all spectral types along the main sequence, subgiants, and giant stars. This sample offers diversity and inclusion of all stellar types, but with thoughtful limits and due attention to main sequence stars. Our targets also include 123 nearby galaxies composed of a “morphological-type-complete” sample of the nearest spirals, ellipticals, dwarf spherioidals, and irregulars. While their great distances hamper the detection of technological electromagnetic radiation, galaxies offer the opportunity to observe billions of stars simultaneously and to sample the bright end of the technological luminosity function. We will also use the Green Bank and Parkes telescopes to survey the plane and central bulge of the Milky Way.

A majority of the key science for the SKA will be addressed through large-area imaging of the Universe at frequencies from 300 MHz to a few GHz. The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is aimed squarely in this frequency range, and achieves instantaneous wide-area imaging through the development and deployment of phase-array feed systems on parabolic reflectors. This large field-of-view makes ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope poised to achieve substantial advances in SKA key science. The central core of ASKAP will be located at the Murchison Radio Observatory in inland Western Australia, one of the most radio-quiet locations on the Earth and one of the sites selected by the international community as a potential location for the SKA. Following an introductory description of ASKAP, this document contains 7 chapters describing specific science programmes for ASKAP. The combination of location, technological innovation and scientific program will ensure that ASKAP will be a world-leading radio astronomy facility, closely aligned with the scientific and technical direction of the SKA. A brief summary chapter emphasizes the point, and considers discovery space.},

abstract = {We have discovered 21 Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) in data from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) 350 MHz Drift-scan and the Green Bank North Celestial Cap pulsar surveys using a new candidate sifting algorithm. RRATs are pulsars with sporadic emission that are detected through their bright single pulses rather than Fourier domain searches. We have developed RRATtrap, a single-pulse sifting algorithm that can be integrated into pulsar survey data analysis pipelines in order to find RRATs and Fast Radio Bursts. We have conducted follow-up observations of our newly discovered sources at several radio frequencies using the GBT and Low Frequency Array, yielding improved positions and measurements of their periods, dispersion measures (DMs), and burst rates, as well as phase-coherent timing solutions for four of them. The new RRATs have DMs ranging from 15 to 97 , periods of 240 ms to 3.4 s, and estimated burst rates of 20 to 400 pulses hr-1 at 350 MHz. We use this new sample of RRATs to perform statistical comparisons between RRATs and canonical pulsars in order to shed light on the relationship between the two populations. We find that the DM and spatial distributions of the RRATs agree with those of the pulsars found in the same survey. We find evidence that slower pulsars (i.e., ms) are preferentially more likely to emit bright single pulses than are faster pulsars ( ms), although this conclusion is tentative. Our results are consistent with the proposed link between RRATs, transient pulsars, and canonical pulsars as sources in various parts of the pulse activity spectrum.},

Previous derived FRB rates from surveys around 1.4{\~{}}GHz, and favoured FRB interpretations, motivated this survey, despite all previous detections occurring at higher dispersion measures. We detected no new FRBs above a signal-to-noise threshold of 10, leading to the most stringent upper limit yet on the FRB event rate at these frequencies: 29 sky{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} day{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for 5{\~{}}ms-duration pulses above 62{\~{}}Jy. The non-detection could be due to scatter-broadening, limitations on the volume and time searched, or the shape of FRB flux density spectra. Assuming the latter and that FRBs are standard candles, the non-detection is compatible with the published FRB sky rate, if their spectra follow a power law with frequency ({\$}\backslashpropto \backslashnu{\^{}}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$}), with {\$}\backslashalpha\backslashgtrsim+0.1{\$}, demonstrating a marked difference from pulsar spectra. Our results suggest that surveys at higher frequencies, including the low frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array, will have better chances to detect, estimate rates and understand the origin and properties of FRBs.},

The combination of coherent dedispersion and the narrow synthesised beam of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope resulted in a sensitive observation. Our improved sensitivity and resolution allow us to confirm the presence of a precursor to the interpulse at these frequencies. We also detected more than 1000 giant pulses and find that the interpulse precursor component shows no giant pulse emission. Therefore, we attribute it to a similar emission source as the precursor to the mainpulse. Together these precursors might be the normal emission seen from the majority of radio pulsars. From the dispersion-free giant pulses, we find that the emission rate is ∼10-20 × 10 -3 s -1 and the scatter timescale in the range of ∼1.5-5.6 ms. We further find that the radio flux of the pulsar is 6-11 Jy in this frequency range. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

abstract = {We describe observations of Rotating RAdio Transients (RRATs) that were discovered in a re-analysis of the Parkes Multi-beam Pulsar Survey (PMPS). The sources have now been monitored for sufficiently long to obtain seven new coherent timing solutions, to make a total of 14 now known. Furthermore we announce the discovery of 7 new transient sources, one of which may be extragalactic in origin (with {\$}z\backslashsim0.1{\$}) and would then be a second example of the so-called `Lorimer burst'. The timing solutions allow us to infer neutron star characteristics such as energy-loss rate, magnetic field strength and evolutionary timescales, as well as facilitating multi-wavelength followup by providing accurate astrometry. All of this enables us to consider the question of whether or not RRATs are in any way special, i.e. a distinct and separate population of neutron stars, as has been previously suggested. We see no reason to consider 'RRAT' as anything other than a detection label, the subject of a selection effect in the parameter space searched. However, single-pulse searches can be utilised to great effect to identify pulsars difficult, or impossible, to find by other means, in particular those with long-periods (half of the PMPS RRATs have periods greater than 4 seconds), high-magnetic field strengths ({\$}B\backslashgtrsim 10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$} G) and pulsars approaching the 'death valley'. The detailed nulling properties of such pulsars are unknown but the mounting evidence suggests a broad range of behaviour in the pulsar population. The group of RRATs fit in to the picture where pulsar magnetospheres switch between stable configurations.},

Although similar modulations of the type III emission have been observed before and were associated with the plasma density fluctuations, the origin of those fluctuations was unknown. Analysis of the striae of the intensity variation in the dynamic spectrum allowed us to reveal two quasi-oscillatory components. The shorter component has the apparent wavelength of {\$}\backslashsim2{\$} Mm, phase speed of {\$}\backslashsim657{\$} km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, which gives the oscillation period of {\$}\backslashsim3{\$} s, and the relative amplitude of {\$}\backslashsim0.35{\$}{\%}. The longer component has the wavelength of {\$}\backslashsim12{\$} Mm, and relative amplitude of {\$}\backslashsim5.1{\$}{\%}. The short frequency range of the detection does not allow us to estimate its phase speed. However, the properties of the shorter oscillatory component allowed us to interpret it as a fast magnetoacoustic wave guided by a plasma non-uniformity along the magnetic field outwards from the Sun. The assumption that the intensity of the radio emission is proportional to the amount of plasma in the emitting volume allowed us to show that the superposition of the plasma density modulation by a fast wave and a longer-wavelength oscillation of an unspecified nature could readily reproduce the fine structure of the observed dynamic spectrum. The observed parameters of the fast wave give the absolute value of the magnetic field in the emitting plasma of {\$}\backslashsim1.1{\$} G which is consistent with the radial magnetic field model.},

Here we report quantitative spatial and frequency characterization of solar radio burst fine structures observed with the Low Frequency Array, an instrument with high-time resolution that also permits imaging at scales much shorter than those corresponding to radio wave propagation in the corona. The observations demonstrate that radio wave propagation effects, and not the properties of the intrinsic emission source, dominate the observed spatial characteristics of radio burst images. These results permit more accurate estimates of source brightness temperatures, and open opportunities for quantitative study of the mechanisms that create the turbulent coronal medium through which the emitted radiation propagates.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. The American Astronomical Society. Type III bursts are generated by fast electron beams originated from magnetic reconnection sites of solar flares. As propagation of radio waves in the interplanetary medium is strongly affected by random electron density fluctuations, type III bursts provide us with a unique diagnostic tool for solar wind remote plasma measurements. Here, we performed a statistical survey of 152 simple and isolated type III bursts observed by the twin-spacecraft Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory mission. We investigated their time-frequency profiles in order to retrieve decay times as a function of frequency. Next, we performed Monte Carlo simulations to study the role of scattering due to random electron density fluctuations on time-frequency profiles of radio emissions generated in the interplanetary medium. For simplification, we assumed the presence of isotropic electron density fluctuations described by a power law with the Kolmogorov spectral index. Decay times obtained from observations and simulations were compared. We found that the characteristic exponential decay profile of type III bursts can be explained by the scattering of the fundamental component between the source and the observer despite restrictive assumptions included in the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. Our results suggest that relative electron density fluctuations in the solar wind are 0.06-0.07 over wide range of heliospheric distances.},

By comparing PSP observations and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict relative density fluctuations {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} at the effective turbulence scale length at radial distances between 2.5{\$}R{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and 14{\$}R{\_}\backslashodot{\$} to range from {\$}0.22{\$} and {\$}0.09{\$}. Finally, we calculated relative density fluctuations {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} measured in situ by PSP at a radial distance from the Sun of {\$}35.7{\$}{\~{}}{\$}R{\_}\backslashodot{\$} during the perihelion $\backslash${\#}1, and the perihelion $\backslash${\#}2 to be {\$}0.07{\$} and {\$}0.06{\$}, respectively. It is in a very good agreement with previous STEREO predictions ({\$}\backslashepsilon=0.06-0.07{\$}) obtained by remote measurements of radio sources generated at this radial distance.},

abstract = {Using observations made with the Nobeyama radio heliograph (NRH) at 17 GHz and the Yohkoh/SXT experiment, we report the first detection of 17 GHz signatures of coronal X-ray bright points (XBP's).  This is also the first reported detection of flaring bright points in microwaves.  We have detected four BP's at 17 GHz out of eight observed by SXT on July 31, 1992, for which we looked for 17 GHz emission.  For one XBP located in a quiet mixed-polarity-region, the peak times at 17 GHz and X-rays are very similar, and both are long lasting - at least 6 hours in duration.  There is a second BP (located near an active region) which is most likely flaring also, but the time profiles in the two spectral domains are not similar.  The other two 17 GHz BPs are quiescent with fluctuations superposed upon them.  For the quiet region XBP, we believe that the 17 GHz emission is thermal.},

abstract = {Breakthrough Listen is the most comprehensive and sensitive search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) to date, employing a collection of international observational facilities including both radio and optical telescopes. During the first three years of the Listen program, thousands of targets have been observed with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), Parkes Telescope and Automated Planet Finder. At GBT and Parkes, observations have been performed ranging from 700 MHz to 26 GHz, with raw data volumes averaging over 1 PB day−1. A pseudo-real time software spectroscopy suite is used to produce multi-resolution spectrograms amounting to approximately 400 GB h−1 GHz−1 beam−1. For certain targets, raw baseband voltage data is also preserved. Observations with the Automated Planet Finder produce both two-dimensional and one-dimensional high-resolution (R ∼ 105) echelle spectral data. Although the primary purpose of Listen data acquisition is for SETI, a range of secondary science has also been performed with these data, including studies of fast radio bursts. Other current and potential research topics include spectral line studies, searches for certain kinds of dark matter, probes of interstellar scattering, pulsar searches, radio transient searches and investigations of stellar activity. Listen data are also being used in the development of algorithms, including machine-learning approaches to modulation scheme classification and outlier detection, that have wide applicability not just for astronomical research but for a broad range of science and engineering. In this paper, we describe the hardware and software pipeline used for collection, reduction, archival, and public dissemination of Listen data. We describe the data formats and tools, and present Breakthrough Listen Data Release 1.0 (BLDR 1.0), a defined set of publicly available raw and reduced data totaling 1 PB.},

abstract = {The Murchison Widefield Array is a dipole-based aperture array synthesis telescope designed to operate in the 80300 MHz frequency range. It is capable of a wide range of science investigations but is initially focused on three key science projects: detection and characterization of three-dimensional brightness temperature fluctuations in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization (EoR) at redshifts from six to ten; solar imaging and remote sensing of the inner heliosphere via propagation effects on signals from distant background sources; and high-sensitivity exploration of the variable radio sky. The array design features 8192 dual-polarization broadband active dipoles, arranged into 512 tiles comprising 16 dipoles each. The tiles are quasi-randomly distributed over an aperture 1.5 km in diameter, with a small number of outliers extending to 3 km. All tiletile baselines are correlated in custom field-programmable gate array based hardware, yielding a Nyquist-sampled instantaneous monochromatic uv coverage and unprecedented point spread function quality. The correlated data are calibrated in real time using novel position-dependent self-calibration algorithms. The array is located in the Murchison region of outback Western Australia. This region is characterized by extremely low population density and a superbly radio-quiet environment, allowing full exploitation of the instrumental capabilities. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

It is shown that suitable conditions for the cyclotron maser instability (CMI) are observed in the regions of the radio sources. Pronounced loss cone in the electron distributions are likely the source of free energy for the instability. The theory reveals that sufficient growth rates are obtained from the distribution functions that are measured by the JADE-Electron instrument. The CMI would be driven by upgoing electron populations at 5–10 keV and 10–30° pitch angle, the amplified waves propagating at 82°–87° from the B field, a fraction of a percent above the gyrofrequency. Typical e-folding times of 10−4 s are obtained, leading to an amplification path of {\~{}}1000 km.

abstract = {The 30-Hz rotation rate of the Crab pulsar has been monitored at Jodrell Bank Observatory since 1984 and by other observatories before then. Since 1968, the rotation rate has decreased by about 0.5 Hz, interrupted only by sporadic and small spin-up events (glitches). 24 of these events have been observed, including a significant concentration of 15 occurring over an interval of 11 yr following MJD 50000. The monotonic decrease of the slowdown rate is partially reversed at glitches. This reversal comprises a step and an asymptotic exponential with a 320-d time constant, as determined in the three best-isolated glitches. The cumulative effect of all glitches is to reduce the decrease in slowdown rate by about 6 per cent. Overall, a low mean braking index of 2.342(1) is measured for the whole period, compared with values close to 2.5 in intervals between glitches. Removing the effects of individual glitches reveals an underlying power-law slowdown with the same braking index of 2.5. We interpret this value in terms of a braking torque due to a dipolar magnetic field in which the inclination angle between the dipole and rotation axes is increasing. There may also be further effects due to a monopolar particle wind or infalling supernova debris.},

abstract = {The Sun regularly produces large-scale eruptive events, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that can drive shock waves through the solar corona. Such shocks can result in electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission in the form of a type II radio burst. However, the early-phase evolution of shock properties and its relationship to type II burst evolution is still subject to investigation. Here we study the evolution of a CME-driven shock by comparing three commonly used methods of calculating the Alfv{\'{e}}n Mach number ( M A ), namely: shock geometry, a comparison of CME speed to a model of the coronal Alfv{\'{e}}n speed, and the type II band-splitting method. We applied the three methods to the 2017 September 2 event, focusing on the shock wave observed in extreme ultraviolet by the Solar Ultraviolet Imager on board GOES-16, in white-light by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph on board SOHO, and the type II radio burst observed by the Irish Low Frequency Array. We show that the three different methods of estimating shock M A yield consistent results and provide a means of relating shock property evolution to the type II emission duration. The type II radio emission emerged from near the nose of the CME when M A was in the range 1.4–2.4 at a heliocentric distance of ∼1.6 R ⊙ . The emission ceased when the CME nose reached ∼2.4 R ⊙ , despite an increasing Alfv{\'{e}}n Mach number (up to 4). We suggest the radio emission cessation is due to the lack of quasi-perpendicular geometry at this altitude, which inhibits efficient electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission.},

abstract = {The Sun's activity leads to bursts of radio emission, among other phenomena. An example is type-III radio bursts. They occur frequently and appear as short-lived structures rapidly drifting from high to low frequencies in dynamic radio spectra. They are usually interpreted as signatures of beams of energetic electrons propagating along coronal magnetic field lines. Here we present novel interferometric LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) observations of three solar type-III radio bursts and their reverse bursts with high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution. They are consistent with a propagation of the radio sources along the coronal magnetic field lines with nonuniform speed. Hence, the type-III radio bursts cannot be generated by a monoenergetic electron beam, but by an ensemble of energetic electrons with a spread distribution in velocity and energy. Additionally, the density profile along the propagation path is derived in the corona. It agrees well with three-fold coronal density model by (1961, ApJ, 133, 983).},

abstract = {Jupiter is a complex and at the same time very powerful radio source in the decameter wavelength range. The emission is anisotropic, intrinsically variable at millisecond to hour timescales, and also modulated by various external processes at much longer periods, ranging from {\~{}}10 h to months or years (including Jovian day and year, solar activity and solar wind variations, and for ground-based observations, terrestrial day and year). As a consequence, long-term observations and their statistical study have proved to be necessary for disentangling and understanding the observed phenomena. We have built a database from the available 26 yr of systematic, daily observations conducted at the Nanc{\c{a}}y Decameter Array and recorded in digital format. This database contains all observed Jovian decametric emissions, classified with respect to the time-frequency morphology, their dominant circular polarization, and maximum frequency. We present the results of the first statistical analysis of this database. We confirm the earlier classification of Jovian decameter emissions in Io-A,-A′,-B,-C,-D and non-Io-A,-B,-C types, but we also introduce new emission types (Io-A′′ and Io-B′) and precise and characterize the non-Io-D type. We determine the contours of all emission types in the CML-$\Phi$Io plane (Central Meridian Longitude in Jupiter's System III coordinates versus Io Phase), provide representative examples of their typical time-frequency patterns, and the distribution of emission's maximum frequency as a function of $\Lambda$Io (Io's Longitude). Finally, we present a statistical analysis of the distributions of the occurrence rate, duration, intensity and polarization for each emission type. non-Io-DAM appears to be related to small-scale, possibly bursty auroral structures.},

It makes extensive use of the proven LOFAR antenna and digital signal-processing hardware, and can act as a stand-alone passive receiver, as a receiver for the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) very high frequency (VHF) incoherent scatter radar in Tromso, or for use in conjunction with other Fenno-Scandinavian VHF experiments. In addition to being a powerful observing instrument in its own right, KAIRA will act as a pathfinder for technologies to be used in the planned EISCAT-3-D phased-array incoherent scatter radar system and participate in very long baseline interferometry experiments. This paper gives an overview of KAIRA, its principal hardware and software components, and its main science objectives. We demonstrate the applicability of the radio astronomy technology to our geoscience application.

abstract = {We have measured variations in scattering time scales in the Crab Pulsar over a 30-year period, using observations made at 610 MHz with the 42-ft telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory. Over more recent years, where regular Lovell Telescope observations at frequencies around 1400 MHz were available, we have also determined the dispersion measure variations, after disentangling the scattering delay from the dispersive delay. We demonstrate a relationship between scattering and dispersion measure variations, with a correlation coefficient of {\$}0.56\backslashpm0.01{\$}. The short time scales over which these quantities vary, the size of the variations, and the close correlation between scattering and dispersion measure all suggest that the effects are due to discrete structures within the Crab Nebula, with size scales of {\$}\backslashsim6{\$} AU (corresponding to an angular size of {\$}\backslashsim2{\$} mas at an assumed distance of 2200 pc). We mitigate the effects of scattering on the observed pulse shape by using the measured scattering information to modify the template used for generating the pulse arrival times, thus improving the precision to which the pulsar can be timed. We test this on timing data taken during periods of high scattering, and obtain a factor of two improvement in the root mean square of the timing residuals.},

abstract = {The radio sky is relatively unexplored for transient signals1, although the potential of radio-transient searches is high. This was demonstrated recently by the discovery of a previously unknown type of source2,3, varying on timescales of minutes to hours. Here we report a search for radio sources that vary on much shorter timescales. We found eleven objects characterized by single, dispersed bursts having durations between 2 and 30 ms. The average time intervals between bursts range from 4 min to 3 h with radio emission typically detectable for {\textless}1 s per day. From an analysis of the burst arrival times, we have identified periodicities in the range 0.4-7 s for ten of the eleven sources, suggesting origins in rotating neutron stars. Despite the small number of sources detected at present, their ephemeral nature implies a total Galactic population significantly exceeding that of the regularly pulsing radio pulsars. Five of the ten sources have periods {\textgreater}4 s, and the rate of change of the pulse period has been measured for three of them; for one source, we have inferred a high magnetic field strength of 5 × 1013 G. This suggests that the new population is related to other classes of isolated neutron stars observed at X-ray and $\gamma$-ray wavelengths4. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The Nan$\backslash$c{\{}c{\}}ay Radioheliograph (NRH) routinely produces snapshot images of the full sun at frequencies between 150 and 450 MHz, with typical resolution 3 arcmin and time cadence 0.2 s. Combining visibilities from the NRH and from the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) allows us to produce images of the sun at 236 or 327 MHz, with a large FOV, high resolution and time cadence. We seek to investigate the structure of noise storms (the most common non-thermal solar radio emission). We focus on the relation of position and altitude of noise storms with the observing frequency and on the lower limit of their sizes. We present results for noise storms on four days. The results consist of an extended halo and of one or several compact cores with relative intensity changing over a few seconds. We found that core sizes can be almost stable over one hour, with a minimum in the range 31-35 arcsec (less than previously reported) and can be stable over one hour. The heliocentric distances of noise storms are {\$}\backslashsim 1.20{\$} and 1.35 {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} at 432 and 150 MHz, respectively. Regions where storms originate are thus much denser than the ambient corona and their vertical extent is found to be less than expected from hydrostatic equilibrium. The smallest observed sizes impose upper limits on broadening effects due to scattering on density inhomogeneities in the low and medium corona and constrain the level of density turbulence in the solar corona. It is possible that scatter broadening has been overestimated in the past, and that the observed sizes cannot only be attributed to scattering. The vertical structure of the noise storms is difficult to reconcile with the classical columnar model.},

abstract = {We report on simultaneous X-ray and radio observations of the mode-switching pulsar PSR B0943+10 obtained with the XMM-Newton satellite and the LOFAR, LWA and Arecibo radio telescopes in November 2014. We confirm the synchronous X-ray/radio switching between a radio-bright (B) and a radio-quiet (Q) mode, in which the X-ray flux is a factor {\~{}}2.4 higher than in the B-mode. We discovered X-ray pulsations, with pulsed fraction of 38+/-5{\%} (0.5-2 keV), during the B-mode, and confirm their presence in Q-mode, where the pulsed fraction increases with energy from {\~{}}20{\%} up to {\~{}}65{\%} at 2 keV. We found marginal evidence for an increase in the X-ray pulsed fraction during B-mode on a timescale of hours. The Q-mode X-ray spectrum requires a fit with a two-component model (either a power-law plus blackbody or the sum of two blackbodies), while the B-mode spectrum is well fit by a single blackbody (a single power-law is rejected). With a maximum likelihood analysis, we found that in Q-mode the pulsed emission has a thermal blackbody spectrum with temperature {\~{}}3.4x10{\^{}}6 K and the unpulsed emission is a power-law with photon index {\~{}}2.5, while during B-mode both the pulsed and unpulsed emission can be fit by either a blackbody or a power law with similar values of temperature and photon index. A Chandra image shows no evidence for diffuse X-ray emission. These results support a scenario in which both unpulsed non-thermal emission, likely of magnetospheric origin, and pulsed thermal emission from a small polar cap ({\~{}}1500 m{\^{}}2) with a strong non-dipolar magnetic field ({\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}} G), are present during both radio modes and vary in intensity in a correlated way. This is broadly consistent with the predictions of the partially screened gap model and does not necessarily imply global magnetospheric rearrangements to explain the mode switching.},

abstract = {We report on simultaneous wideband observations of Crab giant pulses with the Parkes radio tele- scope and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The observations were conducted simultaneously at 732 and 3100MHz with Parkes, and at 120.96, 165.76 and 210.56MHz with the MWA. Flux density calibration of the MWA data was accomplished using a novel technique based on tied-array beam sim- ulations. We detected between 90-648 giant pulses in the 120.96-210.56MHz MWA subbands above a 5:5$\sigma$ threshold while in the Parkes subbands we detected 6344 and 231 giant pulses above a threshold of 6$\sigma$ at 732 and 3100 MHz, respectively. We show, for the first time over a wide frequency range, that the average spectrum of Crab giant pulses exhibits a significant attening at low frequencies. The spectral index, $\alpha$, for giant pulses evolves from a steep, narrow distribution with a mean $\alpha$ = -2:6 and width $\sigma$$\alpha$ = 0:5 between 732 and 3100 MHz, to a wide, at distribution of spectral indices with a mean $\alpha$ = -0:7 and width $\sigma$$\alpha$ = 1:4 between 120.96 and 165.76 MHz. We also comment on the plausibility of giant pulse models for Fast Radio Bursts based on this spectral information.},

Here we present the astrometric and rotational parameters of 20 pulsars discovered as part of LOTAAS. These pulsars have regularly been observed with LOFAR at 149 MHz and the Lovell telescope at 1532 MHz, supplemented by some observations with the Lovell telescope at 334 MHz and the Nan{\c{c}}ay Radio Telescope at 1484 MHz. Timing models are calculated for the 20 pulsars, some of which are among the slowest-spinning pulsars known. PSR J1236−0159 rotates with a period P ∼ 3.6 s, while 5 additional pulsars show P {\textgreater} 2 s. Also, the spin-down rates {\$}\backslashdot{\{}P{\}}{\$} are, on average, low, with PSR J0815+4611 showing {\$}\backslashdot{\{}P{\}} \backslashsim 4\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-18{\}}{\$}. Some of the pulse profiles, generically single-peaked, present complex shapes evolving with frequency. Multi-frequency flux measurements show that these pulsars have generically relatively steep spectra but exceptions are present, with values ranging between ∼−4 and −1. Among the pulsar sample, a large fraction shows large single-pulse variability, with 4 pulsars being undetectable more than {\$}15\backslash{\%}{\$} of the time and one tentatively classified as a Rotating Radio Transient. Two single-peaked pulsars show drifting sub-pulses.},

abstract = {We have observed a complex and continuous change in the integrated pulse profile of PSR B2217+47, manifested as additional components trailing the main peak. These transient components are detected over 6 yr at 150MHz using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), but they are not seen in contemporaneous Lovell observations at 1.5 GHz.We argue that propagation effects in the ionized interstellar medium (IISM) are the most likely cause. The putative structures in the IISM causing the profile variation are roughly half-way between the pulsar and the Earth and have transverse radii R {\~{}} 30 au. We consider different models for the structures. Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, their implied average electron density is ne {\~{}} 100 cm-3. Since PSR B2217+47 is more than an order of magnitude brighter than the average pulsar population visible to LOFAR, similar profile variations would not have been identified in most pulsars, suggesting that subtle profile variations in low-frequency profiles might be more common than we have observed to date. Systematic studies of these variations at low frequencies can provide a new tool to investigate the proprieties of the IISM and the limits to the precision of pulsar timing.},

abstract = {This letter explores the relevance of nanoflare based models for heating the quiet sun corona. Using metrewave data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we present the first successful detection of impulsive emissions down to flux densities of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}mSFU, about two orders of magnitude weaker than earlier attempts. These impulsive emissions have durations {\$}\backslashlesssim 1{\$}s and are present throughout the quiet solar corona. The fractional time occupancy of these impulsive emissions at a given region is {\$}\backslashlesssim 10\backslash{\%}{\$}. The histograms of these impulsive emissions follow a powerlaw distribution and show signs of clustering at small timescales. Our estimate of the energy which must be dumped in the corona to generate these impulsive emissions is consistent with the coronal heating requirements. Additionally, the statistical properties of these impulsive emissions are very similar to those recently determined for magnetic switchbacks by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). We hope that this work will lead to a renewed interest in relating these weak impulsive emissions to the energy deposited in the corona, the quantity of physical interesting from a coronal heating perspective, and explore their relationship with the magnetic switchbacks observed by the PSP.},

These can drive shocks that accelerate particles to high energies, often resulting in radio emission at low frequencies ({\textless}200 MHz). So far, the relationship between the expansion of CMEs, shocks and particle acceleration is not well understood, partly due to the lack of radio imaging at low frequencies during the onset of shock-producing CMEs. Here, we report multi-instrument radio, white-light and ultraviolet imaging of the second largest flare in solar cycle 24 (2008–present) and its associated fast CME (3,038 ± 288 km s −1 ). We identify the location of a multitude of radio shock signatures, called herringbones, and find evidence for shock-accelerated electron beams at multiple locations along the expanding CME.

The mean value of $\delta$NeNe is calculated to be ≈0.006±0.002 over the heliocentric distance range r≈1.6–2.2R⊙. The estimated $\delta$NeNe shows a power law dependence on r with a power law index ≈0.31±0.10. The wavenumber (k) spectrum for the electron density fluctuation ($\delta$NeNe)2 values shows a Kolmogorov-like behavior. Using $\delta$NeNe and the Kolmogorov turbulence index, we estimated the amplitude of density turbulence [Cn2(r)] in the aforementioned range of r.},

The angular size of the smallest, compact radio source that can be observed in the solar atmosphere is one of the intriguing questions in low-frequency radio astronomy. This is important to understand density turbulence in the solar corona and the related angular broadening of the radio source sizes. We used a two-element interferometer with a baseline length of ≈200 km, operating at ≈53 MHz to infer the above limit. Our results indicate that radio sources of angular size ≤15″ exist in the solar corona, where radio emission at the above frequency also originates.},

abstract = {Solar Orbiter, the first mission of ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme and a mission of international collaboration between ESA and NASA, will explore the Sun and heliosphere from close up and out of the ecliptic plane. It was launched on 10 February 2020 04:03 UTC from Cape Canaveral and aims to address key questions of solar and heliospheric physics pertaining to how the Sun creates and controls the Heliosphere, and why solar activity changes with time. To answer these, the mission carries six remote-sensing instruments to observe the Sun and the solar corona, and four in-situ instruments to measure the solar wind, energetic particles, and electromagnetic fields. In this paper, we describe the science objectives of the mission, and how these will be addressed by the joint observations of the instruments onboard. The paper first summarises the mission-level science objectives, followed by an overview of the spacecraft and payload. We report the observables and performance figures of each instrument, as well as the trajectory design. This is followed by a summary of the science operations concept. The paper concludes with a more detailed description of the science objectives. Solar Orbiter will combine in-situ measurements in the heliosphere with high-resolution remote-sensing observations of the Sun to address fundamental questions of solar and heliospheric physics. The performance of the Solar Orbiter payload meets the requirements derived from the mission's science objectives. Its science return will be augmented further by coordinated observations with other space missions and ground-based observatories.},

abstract = {This paper presents SunPy (version 0.5), a community-developed Python package for solar physics. Python, a free, cross-platform, general-purpose, high-level programming language, has seen widespread adoption among the scientific community, resulting in the availability of a large number of software packages, from numerical computation (NumPy, SciPy) and machine learning (scikit-learn) to visualization and plotting (matplotlib). SunPy is a data-analysis environment specializing in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric data in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through integration with the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservices. It currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from e-Callisto and STEREO/SWAVES. We describe SunPys functionality, provide examples of solar data analysis in SunPy, and show how Python-based solar data-analysis can leverage the many existing tools already available in Python. We discuss the future goals of the project and encourage interested users to become involved in the planning and development of SunPy.},

abstract = {Low frequency radio wave scattering and refraction can have a dramatic effect on the observed size and position of radio sources in the solar corona. The scattering and refraction is thought to be due to fluctuations in electron density caused by turbulence. Hence, determining the true radio source size can provide information on the turbulence in coronal plasma. However, the lack of high spatial resolution radio interferometric observations at low frequencies, such as with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), has made it difficult to determine the true radio source size and level of radio wave scattering. Here we directly fit the visibilities of a LOFAR observation of a Type IIIb radio burst with an elliptical Gaussian to determine its source size and position. This circumvents the need to image the source and then de-convolve LOFAR's point spread function, which can introduce spurious effects to the source size and shape. For a burst at 34.76 MHz, we find full width at half maximum (FWHM) heights along the major and minor axes to be 18.8′ ± 0.1′ and 10.2′ ± 0.1′, respectively, at a plane of sky heliocentric distance of 1.75 R⊙. Our results suggest that the level of density fluctuations in the solar corona is the main cause of the scattering of radio waves, resulting in large source sizes. However, the magnitude of ϵ may be smaller than what has been previously derived in observations of radio wave scattering in tied-array images.},

abstract = {Aims. We present the highest-quality polarisation profiles to date of 16 non-recycled pulsars and four millisecond pulsars, observed below 200 MHz with the LOFAR high-band antennas. Based on the observed profiles, we perform an initial investigation of expected observational effects resulting from the propagation of polarised emission in the pulsar magnetosphere and the interstellar medium. Methods. The polarisation data presented in this paper have been calibrated for the geometric-projection and beam-shape effects that distort the polarised information as detected with the LOFAR antennas. We have used RM Synthesis to determine the amount of Faraday rotation in the data at the time of the observations. The ionospheric contribution to the measured Faraday rotation was estimated using a model of the ionosphere. To study the propagation effects, we have compared our low-frequency polarisation observations with archival data at 240, 400, 600, and 1400 MHz. Results. The predictions of magnetospheric birefringence in pulsars have been tested using spectra of the pulse width and fractional polarisation from multifrequency data. The derived spectra offer only partial support for the expected effects of birefringence on the polarisation properties, with only about half of our sample being consistent with the model's predictions. It is noted that for some pulsars these measurements are contaminated by the effects of interstellar scattering. For a number of pulsars in our sample, we have observed significant variations in the amount of Faraday rotation as a function of pulse phase, which is possibly an artefact of scattering. These variations are typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that observed at 1400 MHz by Noutsos et al. (2009), for a different sample of southern pulsars. In this paper we present a possible explanation for the difference in magnitude of this effect between the two frequencies, based on scattering. Finally, we have estimated the magnetospheric emission heights of low-frequency radiation from four pulsars, based on the phase lags between the flux-density and the PA profiles, and the theoretical framework of Blaskiewicz et al. (1991, ApJ, 370, 643). These estimates yielded heights of a few hundred km; at least for PSR B1133+16, this is consistent with emission heights derived based on radius-to-frequency mapping, but is up to a few times larger than the recent upper limit based on pulsar timing. Conclusions. Our work has shown that models, like magnetospheric birefringence, cannot be the sole explanation for the complex polarisation behaviour of pulsars. On the other hand, we have reinforced the claim that interstellar scattering can introduce a rotation of the PA with frequency that is indistinguishable from Faraday rotation and also varies as a function of pulse phase. In one case, the derived emission heights appear to be consistent with the predictions of radius-to-frequency mapping at 150 MHz, although this interpretation is subject to a number of systematic uncertainties.},

These values are found to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day and night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find that lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR results in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of 0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5{\%}. This rate increases approximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR radio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It remains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that integrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for the low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR; accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the proximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be used once low-level RFI starts to become apparent. It is important that the frequency range of LOFAR remains free of broadband interference, such as DAB stations and windmills.},

abstract = {Astronomical widefield imaging of interferometric radio data is computationally expensive, especially for the large data volumes created by modern non-coplanar many-element arrays. We present a new widefield interferometric imager that uses the w-stacking algorithm and can make use of the w-snapshot algorithm. The performance dependencies of CASA's w-projection and our new imager are analysed and analytical functions are derived that describe the required computing cost for both imagers. On data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we find our new method to be an order of magnitude faster than w-projection, as well as being capable of full-sky imaging at full resolution and with correct polarisation correction. We predict the computing costs for several other arrays and estimate that our imager is a factor of 2-12 faster, depending on the array configuration. We estimate the computing cost for imaging the low-frequency Square-Kilometre Array observations to be 60 PetaFLOPS with current techniques. We find that combining w-stacking with the w-snapshot algorithm does not significantly improve computing requirements over pure w-stacking. The source code of our new imager is publicly released.},

In single-frequency mode, the minor loop of our improved multi-scale algorithm is over an order of magnitude faster than the CASA multi-scale algorithm, and produces results of similar quality. For multi-frequency deconvolution, a technique named joined-channel cleaning is used. In this mode, the minor loop of our algorithm is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than CASA MSMFS. We extend the multi-scale mode with automated scale-dependent masking, which allows structures to be cleaned below the noise. We describe a new scale-bias function for use in multi-scale cleaning. We test a second deconvolution method that is a variant of the MORESANE deconvolution technique, and uses a convex optimisation technique with isotropic undecimated wavelets as dictionary. On simple, well calibrated data the convex optimisation algorithm produces visually more representative models. On complex or imperfect data, the convex optimisation algorithm has stability issues.},

abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic astrophysical transients whose brightness requires emitters that are highly energetic, yet compact enough to produce the short, millisecond-duration bursts. FRBs have thus far been detected between 300 MHz and 8 GHz, but lower-frequency emission has remained elusive. A subset of FRBs is known to repeat, and one of those sources, FRB 20180916B, does so with a 16.3 day activity period. Using simultaneous Apertif and LOFAR data, we show that FRB 20180916B emits down to 120 MHz, and that its activity window is both narrower and earlier at higher frequencies. Binary wind interaction models predict a narrower periodic activity window at lower frequencies, which is the opposite of our observations. Our detections establish that low-frequency FRB emission can escape the local medium. For bursts of the same fluence, FRB 20180916B is more active below 200 MHz than at 1.4 GHz. Combining our results with previous upper-limits on the all-sky FRB rate at 150 MHz, we find that there are 3-450 FRBs/sky/day above 50 Jy ms at 90{\%} confidence. We are able to rule out the scenario in which companion winds cause FRB periodicity. We also demonstrate that some FRBs live in clean environments that do not absorb or scatter low-frequency radiation.},

It is focussed on the radio observations of phenomena linked to solar activity in the period going from the first discovery of the radio emissions to present days. We shall present first an overview of solar radio physics focussed on the active Sun and on the premices of solar-terrestrial relationships from the discovery to the 1980s. We shall then discuss the input of radioastronomy both at metric/decimetric wavelengths and at centimetric/millimetric and submillimetric wavelengths to our understanding of flares. We shall also review some of the radio, X-ray and white-light signatures bringing new evidence for reconnection and current sheets in eruptive events. The input of radio images (obtained with a high temporal cadence) to the understanding of the initiation and fast development in the low corona of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as well as the radio observations of shocks in the corona and in the interplanetary medium will be reviewed. The input of radio observations to our knowledge of the interplanetary magnetic structures (ICMEs) will be summarized; we shall show how radio observations linked to the propagation of electron beams allow to identify small scale structures in the heliosphere and to trace the connection between the Sun and interplanetary structures as far as 4AU. We shall also describe how the radio observations bring useful information on the relationship and connections between the energetic electrons in the corona and the electrons measured in-situ. The input of radio observations on the forecasting of the arrival time of shocks at the Earth as well as on Space Weather studies will be described. In the last section, we shall summarize the key results that have contributed to transform our knowledge of solar activity and its link with the interplanetary medium. In conclusion, we shall indicate the instrumental radio developments at Earth and in space, which are from our point of view, necessary for the future of solar and interplanetary physics. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {FRB 20180916B is a well-studied repeating fast radio burst source. Its proximity ({\~{}}150 Mpc), along with detailed studies of the bursts, have revealed many clues about its nature -- including a 16.3-day periodicity in its activity. Here we report on the detection of 18 bursts using LOFAR at 110-188 MHz, by far the lowest-frequency detections of any FRB to date. Some bursts are seen down to the lowest-observed frequency of 110 MHz, suggesting that their spectra extend even lower. These observations provide an order-of-magnitude stronger constraint on the optical depth due to free-free absorption in the source's local environment. The absence of circular polarization and nearly flat polarization angle curves are consistent with burst properties seen at 300-1700 MHz. Compared with higher frequencies, the larger burst widths ({\~{}}40-160 ms at 150 MHz) and lower linear polarization fractions are likely due to scattering. We find {\~{}}2-3 rad/m{\^{}}2 variations in the Faraday rotation measure that may be correlated with the activity cycle of the source. We compare the LOFAR burst arrival times to those of 38 previously published and 22 newly detected bursts from the uGMRT (200-450 MHz) and CHIME/FRB (400-800 MHz). Simultaneous observations show 5 CHIME/FRB bursts when no emission is detected by LOFAR. We find that the burst activity is systematically delayed towards lower frequencies by {\~{}}3 days from 600 MHz to 150 MHz. We discuss these results in the context of a model in which FRB 20180916B is an interacting binary system featuring a neutron star and high-mass stellar companion.},

abstract = {Faraday rotation of polarized emission from pulsars measured at radio frequencies provides a powerful tool to investigate the interstellar and interplanetary magnetic fields. However, besides being sensitive to the astrophysical media, pulsar observations in radio are affected by the highly time-variable ionosphere. In this article, the amount of ionospheric Faraday rotation has been computed by assuming a thin layer model. For this aim, ionospheric maps of the free electron density (based on Global Positioning System data) and semi-empirical geomagnetic models are needed. Through the data of five highly polarized pulsars observed with the individual German LOw-Frequency ARray stations, we investigate the performances of the ionospheric modelling. In addition, we estimate the parameters of the systematics and the correlated noise generated by the residual unmodelled ionospheric effects, and show the comparison of the different free-electron density maps. For the best ionospheric maps, we have found that the rotation measure corrections on one-year timescales after subtraction of diurnal periodicity are accurate to {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 0.06--0.07 rad m{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {We report results from simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of PSR B0611+22 which is known to exhibit bursting in its single-pulse emission. The pulse phase of the bursts vary with radio frequency. The bursts are correlated in 327/150 MHz data sets while they are anti-correlated, with bursts at one frequency associated with normal emission at the other, in 820/150 MHz data sets. Also, the flux density of this pulsar is lower than expected at 327 MHz assuming a power law. We attribute this unusual behaviour to the pulsar itself rather than absorption by external astrophysical sources. Using this data set over an extensive frequency range, we show that the bursting phenomenon in this pulsar exhibits temporal variance over a span of few hours. We also show that the bursting is quasi-periodic over the observed band. The anti-correlation in the phase offset of the burst mode at different frequencies suggests that the mechanisms responsible for phase offset and flux enhancement have different dependencies on the frequency. We did not detect the pulsar with XMM-Newton and place a 99 per cent confidence upper limit on the X-ray efficiency of 10-5.},

abstract = {The Sun frequently accelerates near-relativistic electron beams that travel out through the solar corona and interplanetary space. Interacting with their plasma environment, these beams produce type III radio bursts—the brightest astrophysical radio sources seen from Earth. The formation and motion of type III fine frequency structures is a puzzle, but is commonly believed to be related to plasma turbulence in the solar corona and solar wind. Combining a theoretical framework with kinetic simulations and high-resolution radio type III observations using the Low-Frequency Array, we quantitatively show that the fine structures are caused by the moving intense clumps of Langmuir waves in a turbulent medium. Our results show how type III fine structure can be used to remotely analyse the intensity and spectrum of compressive density fluctuations, and can infer ambient temperatures in astrophysical plasma, substantially expanding the current diagnostic potential of solar radio emission.},

abstract = {Solar flare accelerated electron beams propagating away from the Sun can interact with the turbulent interplanetary media, producing plasma waves and Type III radio emission. These electron beams are detected near the Earth with a double power-law energy spectrum.We simulate electron beam propagation from the Sun to the Earth in the weak turbulent regime taking into account the self-consistent generation of plasmawaves and subsequent wave interaction with density fluctuations from low-frequency MHD turbulence. The rate at which plasma waves are induced by an unstable electron beam is reduced by background density fluctuations, most acutely when fluctuations have large amplitudes or small wavelengths. This suppression of plasma waves alters the wave distribution which changes the electron beam transport. Assuming a 5/3 Kolmogorov-type power-density spectrum of fluctuations often observed near the Earth, we investigate the corresponding energy spectrum of the electron beam after it has propagated 1 AU. We find a direct correlation between the spectrum of the double power-law below the break energy and the turbulent intensity of the background plasma. For an initial spectral index of 3.5, we find a range of spectra below the break energy between 1.6 and 2.1, with higher levels of turbulence corresponding to higher spectral indices. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {A component of space weather, electron beams are routinely accelerated in the solar atmosphere and propagate through interplanetary space. Electron beams interact with Langmuir waves resulting in type III radio bursts. Electron beams expand along the trajectory, and using kinetic simulations, we explore the expansion as the electrons propagate away from the Sun. Specifically, we investigate the front, peak and back of the electron beam in space from derived radio brightness temperatures of fundamental type III emission. The front of the electron beams travelled at speeds from 0.2c--0.7c, significantly faster than the back of the beam that travelled between 0.12c--0.35c. The difference in speed between the front and the back elongates the electron beams in time. The rate of beam elongation has a 0.98 correlation coefficient with the peak velocity; in-line with predictions from type III observations. The inferred speeds of electron beams initially increase close to the acceleration region and then decrease through the solar corona. Larger starting densities and harder initial spectral indices result in longer and faster type III sources. Faster electron beams have higher beam energy densities, produce type IIIs with higher peak brightness temperatures and shorter FWHM durations. Higher background plasma temperatures also increase speeds, particularly at the back of the beam. We show how our predictions of electron beam evolution influences type III bandwidth and drift-rates. Our radial predictions of electron beam speed and expansion can be tested by the upcoming in situ electron beam measurements made by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe.},

@article{Reid2017,
abstract = {Context. Radio U-bursts and J-bursts are signatures of electron beams propagating along magnetic loops confined to the corona. The more commonly observed type III radio bursts are signatures of electron beams propagating along magnetic loops that extend into interplanetary space. Given the prevalence of solar magnetic flux to be closed in the corona, why type III bursts are more frequently observed than U-bursts or J-bursts is an outstanding question. Aims. We use Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) imaging spectroscopy between 30-80 MHz of low-frequency U-bursts and J-bursts, for the first time, to understand why electron beams travelling along coronal loops produce radio emission less often. Radio burst observations provide information not only about the exciting electron beams but also about the structure of large coronal loops with densities that are too low for standard extreme ultraviolet (EUV) or X-ray analysis. Methods. We analysed LOFAR images of a sequence of two J-bursts and one U-burst. The different radio source positions were used to model the spatial structure of the guiding magnetic flux tube and then deduce the energy range of the exciting electron beams without the assumption of a standard density model. We also estimated the electron density along the magnetic flux rope and compared it to coronal models. Results. The radio sources infer a magnetic loop that is 1 solar radius in altitude with the highest frequency sources starting around 0.6 solar radii. Electron velocities were found between 0.13 c and 0.24 c with the front of the electron beam travelling faster than the back of the electron beam. The velocities correspond to energy ranges within the beam from 0.7-11 keV to 0.7-43 keV. The density along the loop is higher than typical coronal density models and the density gradient is smaller. Conclusions. We found that a more restrictive range of accelerated beam and background plasma parameters can result in U-bursts or J-bursts, causing type III bursts to be more frequently observed. The large instability distances required before Langmuir waves are produced by some electron beams, and the small magnitude of the background density gradients makes closed loops less facilitative for radio emission than loops that extend into interplanetary space.},

abstract = {Solar Radio Bursts (SRBs) are generally observed in dynamic spectra and have five major spectral classes, labelled Type I to Type V depending on their shape and extent in frequency and time. Due to their complex characterisation, a challenge in solar radio physics is the automatic detection and classification of such radio bursts. Classification of SRBs has become fundamental in recent years due to large data rates generated by advanced radio telescopes such as the LOw-Frequency ARray, (LOFAR). Current state-of-the-art algorithms implement the Hough or Radon transform as a means of detecting predefined parametric shapes in images. These algorithms achieve up to 84{\%} accuracy, depending on the Type of radio burst being classified. Other techniques include procedures that rely on Constant-FalseAlarm-Rate detection, which is essentially detection of radio bursts using a de-noising and adaptive threshold in dynamic spectra. It works well for a variety of different Types of radio bursts and achieves an accuracy of up to 70{\%}. In this research, we are introducing a methodology named You Only Look Once v2 (YOLOv2) for solar radio burst classification. By using Type III simulation methods we can train the algorithm to classify real Type III solar radio bursts in real-time at an accu},

abstract = {CNN-based optical flow estimation has attracted attention recently, mainly due to its impressively high frame rates. These networks perform well on synthetic datasets, but they are still far behind the classical methods in real-world videos. This is because there is no ground truth optical flow for training these networks on real data. In this paper, we boost CNN-based optical flow estimation in real scenes with the help of the freely available self-supervised task of next-frame prediction. To this end, we train the network in a hybrid way, providing it with a mixture of synthetic and real videos. With the help of a sample-variant multi-tasking architecture, the network is trained on different tasks depending on the availability of ground-truth. We also experiment with the prediction of "next-flow" instead of estimation of the current flow, which is intuitively closer to the task of next-frame prediction and yields favorable results. We demonstrate the improvement in optical flow estimation on the real-world KITTI benchmark. Additionally, we test the optical flow indirectly in an action classification scenario. As a side product of this work, we report significant improvements over state-of-the-art in the task of next-frame prediction.},

abstract = {Quiet sun meterwave emission arises from thermal bremsstrahlung in the MK corona, and can potentially be a rich source of coronal diagnostics. On its way to the observer, it gets modified substantially due to the propagation effects - primarily refraction and scattering - through the magnetized and turbulent coronal medium, leading to the redistribution of the intensity in the image plane. By comparing the full-disk meterwave solar maps during a quiet solar period and the modelled thermal bremsstrahlung emission, we characterise these propagation effects. The solar radio maps between 100 and 240 MHz come from the Murchison Widefield Array. FORWARD package is used to simulate thermal bremsstrahlung images using the self-consistent Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere coronal model. The FORWARD model does not include propagation effects. The differences between the observed and modelled maps are interpreted to arise due to scattering and refraction. There is a good general correspondence between the predicted and observed brightness distributions, though significant differences are also observed. We find clear evidence for the presence of significant propagation effects, including anisotropic scattering. The observed radio size of the Sun is 25--30$\backslash${\%} larger in area. The emission peak corresponding to the only visible active region shifts by 8'--11' and its size increases by 35--40$\backslash${\%}. Our simple models suggest that the fraction of scattered flux density is always larger than a few tens of percent, and varies significantly between different regions. We estimate density inhomogeneities to be in the range 1--10$\backslash${\%}.},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Since its formulation by Hamaker et al., the radio interferometer measurement equation (RIME) has provided a rigorous mathematical basis for the development of novel calibration methods and techniques, including various approaches to the problem of direction-dependent effects (DDEs). However, acceptance of the RIME in the radio astronomical community at large has been slow, which is partially due to the limited availability of software to exploit its power, and the sparsity of practical results. This needs to change urgently.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} This series of papers aims to place recent developments in the treatment of DDEs into one RIME-based mathematical framework, and to demonstrate the ease with which the various effects can be described and understood. It also aims to show the benefits of a RIME-based approach to calibration. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Paper I re-derives the RIME from first principles, extends the formalism to the full-sky case, and incorporates DDEs. Paper II then uses the formalism to describe self-calibration, both with a full RIME, and with the approximate equations of older software packages, and shows how this is affected by DDEs. It also gives an overview of real-life DDEs and proposed methods of dealing with them. Finally, in Paper III some of these methods are exercised to achieve an extremely high-dynamic range calibration of WSRT observations of 3C 147 at 21 cm, with full treatment of DDEs.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The RIME formalism is extended to the full-sky case (Paper I), and is shown to be an elegant way of describing calibration and DDEs (Paper II). Applying this to WSRT data (Paper III) results in a noise-limited image of the field around 3C 147 with a very high dynamic range (1.6 million), and none of the off-axis artifacts that plague regular selfcal. The resulting differential gain solutions contain significant information on DDEs and errors in the sky model.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The RIME is a powerful formalism for describing radio interferometry, and underpins the development of novel calibration methods, in particular those dealing with DDEs. One of these is the differential gains approach used for the 3C 147 reduction. Differential gains can eliminate DDE-related artifacts, and provide information for iterative improvements of sky models. Perhaps most importantly, sources as faint as 2 mJy have been shown to yield meaningful differential gain solutions, and thus can be used as potential calibration beacons in other DDE-related schemes.},

abstract = {Recent radio wave interplanetary scintillation observations have improved our knowledge of the level of turbulent fluctuations of plasma density in the inner solar wind at heliocentric distances of 16-26 R-. and less accurately outside this range. This information relates to fluctuations in the inertial subrange of the turbulence. Of particular concern in this paper is the heliocentric distance dependence of the power-law normalization parameter C-N(2). This measurement of C-N(2), when combined with independent measurements of the mean plasma density in the inner solar wind, indicates that the dimensionless amplitude of the turbulence epsilon = sigma(n)/(n) over bar is low, of the order of 6{\%}-15{\%}, where sigma(n) is the standard deviation of the density fluctuations and (n) over bar is the mean value. The deduced value for epsilon depends on an assumed value for the outer scale of the turbulence, l(o). I adopt a fiducial value of l(o) = 1 R-.. A comparison is made with independent estimates of epsilon, from both radio remote sensing in the same part of space and in situ measurements at greater distances. Satisfactory agreement occurs. I discuss the possibility that this dimensionless density amplitude epsilon might be a proxy for the corresponding amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuations. This is a controversial assertion. However, if it is the case, the measurements suggest that the turbulence in the inner solar wind is weak, in the sense of being dynamically and thermodynamically important.},

abstract = {We report observations of Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) phase scintillations due to turbulence in the solar wind. The observations were made at 5.00 and 8.42 GHz with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) on three dates in 1991 July and August. We observed the sources 0851 + 202 and 0735+178 at solar elongations ranging from 2 degrees.66 to 13 degrees.29; the closest approach of the line of sight to the Sun ranged from 10 to 49.8 R(.). We have also included previously unpublished 5 GHz VLBI phase scintillation measurements from 1989. These measurements probe solar wind density fluctuations on spatial scales from about 200 km to 2000 km. Our measurements are in quite good agreement with the Coles {\&} Harmon model for the radio phase structure function, which was largely determined from observations on both shorter and larger spatial scales. Departures from the Coles {\&} Harmon functions are attributable to day-to-day variations in the solar wind conditions. Phase scintillations at the greatest solar elongations are in very good agreement with extrapolated estimates from direct measurements made with the Helios spacecraft at slightly larger heliocentric distances. Thus there is a consistency between the in situ spacecraft and radio remote sensing measurements of density turbulence. All of the VLBI data are consistent with a Kolmogorov spectrum for the density fluctuations, although at the closest elongations there may be excess power at small spatial scales. An advantage of interferometric techniques over other radio propagation measurements is that they provide a measure of the anisotropy of the irregularities. Our observations at closest approach (10 R,) show weak evidence for anisotropic, held-aligned density irregularities with an axial ratio of order 2. This degree of anisotropy would appear to be less than that measured at similar solar elongations but on smaller spatial scales by Armstrong and colleagues. Finally, a combination of the radio propagation data and in situ Hellos measurements is used to determine the heliocentric distance dependence of the normalization coefficient of the density power spectrum, C-N(2). Modeling C-N(2) proportional to (R/R(.))(-kappa), we find kappa = 3.72 +/- 0.30. Subject to a number of assumptions, this result is consistent with the conclusion of D. A. Roberts that turbulence within 0.28 astronomical units adheres to a WKB formula for turbulence amplitude as a function of heliocentric distance.},

The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) is a new radio interferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric "radio window": 10-240 MHz, that will greatly facilitate observing pulsars at low radio frequencies. Through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexible digital hardware, it is expected that LOFAR will revolutionize radio astronomy at the lowest frequencies visible from Earth. LOFAR is a next-generation radio telescope and a pathfinder to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), in that it incorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individual elements. We discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations in general and the potential of LOFAR in addressing these science goals. We present LOFAR as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations of pulsars and other fast transients, and outline the various relevant observing modes and data reduction pipelines that are already or will soon be implemented to facilitate these observations. A number of results obtained from commissioning observations are presented to demonstrate the exciting potential of the telescope. This paper outlines the case for low frequency pulsar observations and is also intended to serve as a reference for upcoming pulsar/fast transient science papers with LOFAR. {\textcopyright} 2011 ESO.},

We subsequently detected pulsations from the pulsar in the interferometric images of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, allowing for sub-arcsecond localization. This, along with a pre-discovery detection 2 years prior, allowed us to measure the spin-period derivative to be {\$}\backslashdot{\{}P{\}}=2.7 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-14{\}}{\$} s s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. The observed spin period derivative of PSR J0250+5854 indicates a surface magnetic field strength, characteristic age and spin-down luminosity of {\$}2.6 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$}G, {\$}13.7{\$} Myr and {\$}8.2 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}28{\}}{\$} erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} respectively, for a dipolar magnetic field configuration. This also places the pulsar beyond the conventional pulsar death line, where radio emission is expected to cease. The spin period of PSR J0250+5854 is similar to those of the high-energy-emitting magnetars and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs). However, the pulsar was not detected by the Swift/XRT in the energy band of 0.3-10 keV, placing a bolometric luminosity limit of {\$}1.5 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}32{\}}{\$} erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for an assumed {\$}N{\_}{\{}\backslashrm H{\}}=1.35\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}21{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} and a temperature of 85 eV (typical of XDINSs). We discuss the implications of the discovery for models of the pulsar death line as well as the prospect of finding more similarly long-period pulsars, including the advantages provided by LOTAAS for this.},

abstract = {We report on the multifrequency timing observations of 21 pulsars discovered in the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS). The timing data were taken at central frequencies of 149 MHz (LOFAR) as well as 334 and 1532 MHz (Lovell Telescope). The sample of pulsars includes 20 isolated pulsars and the first binary pulsar discovered by the survey, PSR J1658+3630. We modelled the timing properties of the pulsars, which showed that they have, on average, larger characteristic ages. We present the pulse profiles of the pulsars across the three observing bands, where PSR J1643+1338 showed profile evolution that appears not to be well-described by the radius-to-frequency-mapping model. Furthermore, we modelled the spectra of the pulsars across the same observing bands, using a simple power law, and found an average spectral index of −1.9 ± 0.5. Amongst the pulsars studied here, PSR J1657+3304 showed large flux density variations of a factor of 10 over 300 d, as well as mode changing and nulling on time-scales of a few minutes. We modelled the rotational and orbital properties of PSR J1658+3630, which has a spin period of 33 ms in a binary orbit of 3.0 d with a companion of minimum mass of 0.87 M⊙, likely a carbon–oxygen or oxygen–neon–magnesium type white dwarf. PSR J1658+3630 has a dispersion measure of 3.0 pc cm−3, making it possibly one of the closest binary pulsars known.},

abstract = {The observations of the quiet Sun at meter and decameter wavelengths show that its brightness temperatures can be {\~{}}1 order of magnitude lower than the expected values of 106 K and the apparent diameters can be very large. We examine whether this unusual behavior is due to refraction in the smoothly varying coronal plasma and scattering by random density fluctuations using an improved Monte Carlo simulation technique. We use a three-dimensional model for the electron density, --{\textgreater}Ne, and a power-law spectrum for the density fluctuations with an exponential index of $\alpha$. We consider two cases: (1) --{\textgreater}$\alpha$ = 11/3 (Kolmogorov spectrum), relative level of density fluctuations --{\textgreater} = $\Delta$ Ne/Ne = 0.1, and scale heights ranging from the inner scale --{\textgreater}li = 684(Ne cm −3)−1/2 to outer scale --{\textgreater}lo = 106li, and (2) --{\textgreater}$\alpha$ = 3 (flat spectrum), --{\textgreater} = 0.02, and scale heights ranging from 50 to 75 km. We consider the fluctuations to be anisotropic with axial ratios of {\~{}}10. The Kolmogorov type of fluctuations yield slightly lower brightness temperatures in comparison with those of a flat spectrum. The brightness temperature distributions, east-west diameters, and central brightness temperatures at various frequencies indicate that the refraction and scattering are probably the underlying reasons for the unusual behavior of the quiet-Sun radio emission. This study clearly demonstrates that Monte Carlo techniques can be very effective in extracting the coronal electron temperatures accurately from the radio data, provided the information about the density distributions and density fluctuations is known by some independent methods.},

abstract = {The solar transition region (TR) is the temperature regime from roughly 0.02MK to 0.8MK in the solar atmosphere. It is the transition layer from the collisional and partially ionized chromosphere to the collisionless and fully ionized corona. The TR plays an important role in the mass and energy transport in both the quiet solar atmosphere and solar eruptions. Most of the TR emission lines fall into the spectral range of far ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet (∼400 {\AA}-1600{\AA}). Imaging and spectroscopic observations in this spectral range are the most important ways to obtain information about the physics of the TR. Static solar atmosphere models predict a very thin TR. However, recent highresolution observations indicate that the TR is highly dynamic and inhomogeneous. I will summarize some major findings about the TR made through imaging and spectroscopic observations in the past 20 years. These existing observations have demonstrated that the TR may be the key to understanding coronal heating and origin of the solar wind. Future exploration of the solar TR may need to focus on the upper TR, since the plasma in this temperature regime (0.1MK-0.8MK) has not been routinely imaged before. High-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations of the upper TR will not only allow us to track the mass and energy from the lower atmosphere to the corona, but also help us to understand the initiation and heating mechanisms of coronal mass ejections and solar flares.},

abstract = {Dispersive delays due to the solar wind introduce excess noise in high-precision pulsar timing experiments, and must be removed in order to achieve the accuracy needed to detect, e.g., low-frequency gravitational waves. In current pulsar timing experiments, this delay is usually removed by approximating the electron density distribution in the solar wind either as spherically symmetric or with a two-phase model that describes the contributions from both high- and low-speed phases of the solar wind. However, no data set has previously been available to test the performance and limitations of these models over extended time-scales and with sufficient sensitivity. Here we present the results of such a test with an optimal data set of observations of pulsar J0034-0534, taken with the German stations of LOFAR. We conclude that the spherical approximation performs systematically better than the two-phase model at almost all angular distances, with a rms given by the two-phase model being up to 28 per cent larger than the result obtained with the spherical approximation. Never the less, the spherical approximation remains insufficiently accurate in modelling the solar wind delay (especially within 20 degrees of angular distance from the Sun), as it leaves timing residuals with rms values that reach the equivalent of 0.3 $\mu$s at 1400 MHz. This is because a spherical model ignores the large daily variations in electron density observed in the solar wind. In the short term, broad-band observations or simultaneous observations at low frequencies are the most promising way forward to correct for solar-wind-induced delay variations.},

abstract = {Neutrinos are fundamental particles ubiquitous in the Universe. Their properties remain elusive despite more than 50 years of intense research activity. In this review we remind the reader of the noticeable properties of these particles and of the stakes of the solar neutrino puzzle. The Standard Solar Model triggered persistent efforts in fundamental Physics to predict the solar neutrino fluxes, and its constantly evolving predictions have been regularly compared to the detected neutrino signals. Anticipating that this standard model could not reproduce the internal solar dynamics, a SEismic Solar Model was developed which enriched theoretical neutrino flux predictions with in situ observation of acoustic waves propagating in the Sun. This review reminds the historical steps, from the pioneering Homestake detection, the GALLEX- SAGE captures of the first pp neutrinos and emphasizes the importance of the Superkamiokande and SNO detectors to demonstrate that the solar-emitted electronic neutrinos are partially transformed into other neutrino flavors before reaching the Earth. The success of BOREXINO in detecting the 7 Be neutrino signal justifies the building of a new generation of detectors to measure the entire solar neutrino spectrum. A coherent picture emerged from neutrino physics and helioseismology. Today, new paradigms take shape: determining the masses of neutrinos and the research on the Sun is focusing on the dynamical aspects and on signature of dark matter. The third part of the review is dedicated to this prospect. The understanding of the crucial role of both rotation and magnetism in solar physics benefit from SoHO, SDO, and PICARD space observations. For now, the particle and stellar challenges seem decoupled, but this is only a superficial appearance. The development of asteroseismology shows the far-reaching impact of Neutrino and Stellar Astronomy.},

abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

abstract = {Bright short radio bursts are emitted by sources at a wide range of distances: from the nearby Crab pulsar to remote fast radio bursts (FRBs). FRBs are likely to originate from distant neutron stars, but our knowledge of the radio pulsar population has been limited to the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. In an attempt to increase our understanding of extragalactic pulsar populations and their giant-pulse emission, we employed the low-frequency radio telescope LOFAR to search the Andromeda galaxy (M 31) for radio bursts emitted by young Crab-like pulsars. For direct comparison we also present a LOFAR study on the low-frequency giant pulses from the Crab pulsar; their fluence distribution follows a power law with slope 3.04ℓ ±ℓ 0.03. A number of candidate signals were detected from M 31, but none proved persistent. FRBs are sometimes thought of as Crab-like pulsars with exceedingly bright giant pulses; based on our sensitivity, we can rule out that M 31 hosts pulsars that are more than an order of magnitude brighter than the Crab pulsar if their pulse scattering follows that of the known FRBs.},

The ingest pipeline is a distributed real time software which runs on this cluster and prepares the data for further (offline) processing by imaging and calibration pipelines. In addition to its main functionality, it turned out to be a valuable tool for various commissioning experiments and allowed us to run an interim system to achieve the first scientific results much earlier than otherwise possible.

abstract = {The paper describes observations with a 40-240 McJs radio spectroscope leading to the discovery and preliminary investigation of harmonics in the spectra of sporadic bursts from the SWl. It is found that spectral features of bursts are commonly duplicated with a 2: 1 frequency separation. The ratio is sometimes appreciably lower though apparently never greater. This and other features of the spectra are shown to support the hypothesis that the fundamental frequency corresponds to the natural plasma frequency of the corona in the vicinity of the source. By applying this result to a standard model of the corona, information on the position, velocity, and size of the sources is deduced. The results suggest that the generation of bursts may be associated with longitudinal plasma oscillations excited by fast streams of charged particles.},

abstract = {Temporal power spectra have been computed from recordings of the downlink frequency fluctuations of the Galileo and Ulysses radio signals during their solar conjunctions. Both the equatorial streamer belt and the polar coronal holes were investigated over a range of ray path solar offset distances from 4 to 80 R⊙. By combining gapless data from successive tracking passes, Doppler scintillation power spectra could be computed down to extremely low frequencies. Some spectra feature a low-frequency turnover at frequencies around 0.1 mHz that could be interpreted as an outer scale of density turbulence in the coronal plasma.},

abstract = {Interstellar scattering is known to broaden distant objects spatially and temporally. The latter aspect is difficult to analyse, unless the signals carry their own time stamps. Pulsars are so kind to do us this favour. Typically the signature is a broadened image with little or no substructure and a similarly smooth exponential scattering tail in the temporal profile. The case of the pulsar B1508+55 is special: The profile shows additional components that are moving relative to the main pulse with time. We use low-frequency VLBI with LOFAR to test the hypothesis that these components are actually such scattering-induced echoes, by trying to detect the expected angular offset. Using international stations (plus the Kilpisj{\"{a}}rvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array ‘KAIRA') and the phased-up core of the LOFAR array, we can do interferometry at high resolution in time and space.},

abstract = {Context. Type II radio bursts are evidence of shocks in the solar atmosphere and inner heliosphere that emit radio waves ranging from sub-meter to kilometer lengths. These shocks may be associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and reach speeds higher than the local magnetosonic speed. Radio imaging of decameter wavelengths (20–90 MHz) is now possible with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), opening a new radio window in which to study coronal shocks that leave the inner solar corona and enter the interplanetary medium and to understand their association with CMEs.},
