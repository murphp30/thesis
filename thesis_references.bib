abstract = {Significant new opportunities for astrophysics and cosmology have been identified at low radio frequencies. The Murchison Widefield Array is the first telescope in the southern hemisphere designed specifically to explore the low-frequency astronomical sky between 80 and 300 MHz with arcminute angular resolution and high survey efficiency. The telescope will enable new advances along four key science themes, including searching for redshifted 21-cm emission from the EoR in the early Universe; Galactic and extragalactic all-sky southern hemisphere surveys; time-domain astrophysics; and solar, heliospheric, and ionospheric science and space weather. The Murchison Widefield Array is located in Western Australia at the site of the planned Square Kilometre Array (SKA) low-band telescope and is the only low-frequency SKA precursor facility. In this paper, we review the performance properties of the Murchison Widefield Array and describe its primary scientific objectives. {\textcopyright} 2013 Astronomical Society of Australia.},

abstract = {The Sun regularly produces large-scale eruptive events, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that can drive shock waves through the solar corona. Such shocks can result in electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission in the form of a type II radio burst. However, the early-phase evolution of shock properties and its relationship to type II burst evolution is still subject to investigation. Here we study the evolution of a CME-driven shock by comparing three commonly used methods of calculating the Alfv$\backslash$'en Mach number ({\$}M{\_}A{\$}), namely: shock geometry, a comparison of CME speed to a model of the coronal Alfv$\backslash$'en speed, and the type II band-splitting method. We applied the three methods to the 2017 September 2 event, focusing on the shock wave observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) by the Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) on board GOES-16, in white-light by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board SOHO, and the type II radio burst observed by the Irish Low Frequency Array (I-LOFAR). We show that the three different methods of estimating shock {\$}M{\_}A{\$} yield consistent results and provide a means of relating shock property evolution to the type II emission duration. The type II radio emission emerged from near the nose of the CME when {\$}M{\_}A{\$} was in the range 1.4-2.4 at a heliocentric distance of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1.6 {\$}R{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. The emission ceased when the CME nose reached {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2.4 {\$}R{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, despite an increasing Alfv$\backslash$'en Mach number (up to 4). We suggest the radio emission cessation is due to the lack of quasi-perpendicular geometry at this altitude, which inhibits efficient electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission.},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} New generation low-frequency telescopes are exploring a new parameter space in terms of depth and resolution. The data taken with these interferometers, for example with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), are often calibrated in a low signal-to-noise ratio regime and the removal of critical systematic effects is challenging. The process requires an understanding of their origin and properties.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aim.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} In this paper we describe the major systematic effects inherent to next generation low-frequency telescopes, such as LOFAR. With this knowledge, we introduce a data processing pipeline that is able to isolate and correct these systematic effects. The pipeline will be used to calibrate calibrator observations as the first step of a full data reduction process.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We processed two LOFAR observations of the calibrator 3C 196: the first using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) system at 42–66 MHz and the second using the High Band Antenna (HBA) system at 115–189 MHz.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We were able to isolate and correct for the effects of clock drift, polarisation misalignment, ionospheric delay, Faraday rotation, ionospheric scintillation, beam shape, and bandpass. The designed calibration strategy produced the deepest image to date at 54 MHz. The image has been used to confirm that the spectral energy distribution of the average radio source population tends to flatten at low frequencies.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We prove that LOFAR systematic effects can be described by a relatively small number of parameters. Furthermore, the identification of these parameters is fundamental to reducing the degrees of freedom when the calibration is carried out on fields that are not dominated by a strong calibrator.},

abstract = {The observations of the quiet Sun at meter and decameter wavelengths show that its brightness temperatures can be {\~{}}1 order of magnitude lower than the expected values of 106 K and the apparent diameters can be very large. We examine whether this unusual behavior is due to refraction in the smoothly varying coronal plasma and scattering by random density fluctuations using an improved Monte Carlo simulation technique. We use a three-dimensional model for the electron density, --{\textgreater}Ne, and a power-law spectrum for the density fluctuations with an exponential index of $\alpha$. We consider two cases: (1) --{\textgreater}$\alpha$ = 11/3 (Kolmogorov spectrum), relative level of density fluctuations --{\textgreater} = $\Delta$ Ne/Ne = 0.1, and scale heights ranging from the inner scale --{\textgreater}li = 684(Ne cm −3)−1/2 to outer scale --{\textgreater}lo = 106li, and (2) --{\textgreater}$\alpha$ = 3 (flat spectrum), --{\textgreater} = 0.02, and scale heights ranging from 50 to 75 km. We consider the fluctuations to be anisotropic with axial ratios of {\~{}}10. The Kolmogorov type of fluctuations yield slightly lower brightness temperatures in comparison with those of a flat spectrum. The brightness temperature distributions, east-west diameters, and central brightness temperatures at various frequencies indicate that the refraction and scattering are probably the underlying reasons for the unusual behavior of the quiet-Sun radio emission. This study clearly demonstrates that Monte Carlo techniques can be very effective in extracting the coronal electron temperatures accurately from the radio data, provided the information about the density distributions and density fluctuations is known by some independent methods.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019. The American Astronomical Society.. Low-frequency radio observations make it possible to study the solar corona at distances up to 2-3 R. Frequency of plasma emission is a proxy for electron density of the emitting plasma and, therefore, observations of solar radio bursts can be used to probe the density structure of the outer corona. In this study, positions of solar radio sources are investigated using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) spectral imaging in the frequency range 30-50 MHz. We show that there are events where apparent positions of the radio sources cannot be explained using the standard coronal density models. Namely, the apparent heliocentric positions of the sources are 0.1-0.7 R further from the Sun compared with the positions predicted by the Newkirk model, and these shifts are frequency-dependent. We discuss several possible explanations for this effect, including enhanced plasma density in the flaring corona, as well as scattering and refraction of the radio waves.},

abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

abstract = {Cosmic rays and solar energetic particles may be accelerated to relativistic energies by shock waves in astrophysical plasmas. On the Sun, shocks and particle acceleration are often associated with the eruption of magnetized plasmoids, called coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, the physical relationship between CMEs and shock particle acceleration is not well understood. Here, we use extreme ultraviolet, radio and white-light imaging of a solar eruptive event on 22 September 2011 to show that a CME-induced shock (Alfv{\'{e}}n Mach number 2.4 +0.7-0.8 ) was coincident with a coronal wave and an intense metric radio burst generated by intermittent acceleration of electrons to kinetic energies of 2-46 keV (0.1-0.4 c). Our observations show that plasmoid-driven quasiperpendicular shocks are capable of producing quasiperiodic acceleration of electrons, an effect consistent with a turbulent or rippled plasma shock surface. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

This is also the first reported detection of flaring bright points in microwaves.  We have detected four BP's at 17 GHz out of eight observed by SXT on July 31, 1992, for which we looked for 17 GHz emission.  For one XBP located in a quiet mixed-polarity-region, the peak times at 17 GHz and X-rays are very similar, and both are long lasting - at least 6 hours in duration.  There is a second BP (located near an active region) which is most likely flaring also, but the time profiles in the two spectral domains are not similar.  The other two 17 GHz BPs are quiescent with fluctuations superposed upon them.  For the quiet region XBP, we believe that the 17 GHz emission is thermal.},

abstract = {Astronomical widefield imaging of interferometric radio data is computationally expensive, especially for the large data volumes created by modern non-coplanar many-element arrays. We present a new widefield interferometric imager that uses the w-stacking algorithm and can make use of the w-snapshot algorithm. The performance dependencies of CASA's w-projection and our new imager are analysed and analytical functions are derived that describe the required computing cost for both imagers. On data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we find our new method to be an order of magnitude faster than w-projection, as well as being capable of full-sky imaging at full resolution and with correct polarisation correction. We predict the computing costs for several other arrays and estimate that our imager is a factor of 2-12 faster, depending on the array configuration. We estimate the computing cost for imaging the low-frequency Square-Kilometre Array observations to be 60 PetaFLOPS with current techniques. We find that combining w-stacking with the w-snapshot algorithm does not significantly improve computing requirements over pure w-stacking. The source code of our new imager is publicly released.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. The American Astronomical Society. Type III bursts are generated by fast electron beams originated from magnetic reconnection sites of solar flares. As propagation of radio waves in the interplanetary medium is strongly affected by random electron density fluctuations, type III bursts provide us with a unique diagnostic tool for solar wind remote plasma measurements. Here, we performed a statistical survey of 152 simple and isolated type III bursts observed by the twin-spacecraft Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory mission. We investigated their time-frequency profiles in order to retrieve decay times as a function of frequency. Next, we performed Monte Carlo simulations to study the role of scattering due to random electron density fluctuations on time-frequency profiles of radio emissions generated in the interplanetary medium. For simplification, we assumed the presence of isotropic electron density fluctuations described by a power law with the Kolmogorov spectral index. Decay times obtained from observations and simulations were compared. We found that the characteristic exponential decay profile of type III bursts can be explained by the scattering of the fundamental component between the source and the observer despite restrictive assumptions included in the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. Our results suggest that relative electron density fluctuations in the solar wind are 0.06-0.07 over wide range of heliospheric distances.},

abstract = {Context. The Sun is an active star and the source of the largest explosions in the solar system, such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Flares and CMEs are powerful particle accelerators that can generate radio emission through various emission mechanisms. Aims. CMEs are often accompanied by Type IV radio bursts that are observed as continuum emission in dynamic spectra at decimetric and metric wavelengths, but their emission mechanism can vary from event to event. Here, we aim to determine the emission mechanism of a complex Type IV burst that accompanied the flare and CME on 22 September 2011. Methods. We used radio imaging from the Nan$\backslash$c{\{}c{\}}ay Radioheliograph, spectroscopic data from the e-Callisto network, ARTEMIS, Ondrejov, and Phoenix3 spectrometers combined with extreme-ultraviolet observations from NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory to analyse the Type IV radio burst and determine its emission mechanism. Results. We show that the emission mechanism of the Type IV radio burst changes over time. We identified two components in the Type IV radio burst: an earlier stationary Type IV showing gyro-synchrotron behaviour, and a later moving Type IV burst covering the same frequency band. This second component has a coherent emission mechanism. Fundamental plasma emission and the electroncyclotron maser emission are further investigated as possible emission mechanisms for the generation of the moving Type IV burst. Conclusions. Type IV bursts are therefore complex radio bursts, where multiple emission mechanisms can contribute to the generation of the wide-band continuum observed in dynamic spectra. Imaging spectroscopy over a wide frequency band is necessary to determine the emission mechanisms of Type IV bursts that are observed in dynamic spectra.},

abstract = {Solar Orbiter, the first mission of ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme and a mission of international collaboration between ESA and NASA, will explore the Sun and heliosphere from close up and out of the ecliptic plane. It was launched on 10 February 2020 04:03 UTC from Cape Canaveral and aims to address key questions of solar and heliospheric physics pertaining to how the Sun creates and controls the Heliosphere, and why solar activity changes with time. To answer these, the mission carries six remote-sensing instruments to observe the Sun and the solar corona, and four in-situ instruments to measure the solar wind, energetic particles, and electromagnetic fields. In this paper, we describe the science objectives of the mission, and how these will be addressed by the joint observations of the instruments onboard. The paper first summarises the mission-level science objectives, followed by an overview of the spacecraft and payload. We report the observables and performance figures of each instrument, as well as the trajectory design. This is followed by a summary of the science operations concept. The paper concludes with a more detailed description of the science objectives. Solar Orbiter will combine in-situ measurements in the heliosphere with high-resolution remote-sensing observations of the Sun to address fundamental questions of solar and heliospheric physics. The performance of the Solar Orbiter payload meets the requirements derived from the mission's science objectives. Its science return will be augmented further by coordinated observations with other space missions and ground-based observatories.},

LOFAR, a new-generation radio telescope centered in the Netherlands with international stations in Germany, France, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, Sweden and the UK, has successfully used software real-time processors based on IBM Blue Gene technology since 2004. Since then, developments in technology have allowed us to build a system based on commercial off-the-shelf components that combines the same capabilities with lower operational cost. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a GPU-based correlator and beamformer with the same capabilities as the Blue Gene based systems. We focus on the design approach taken, and show the challenges faced in selecting an appropriate system. The design, implementation and verification of the software system shows the value of a modern test-driven development approach. Operational experience, based on three years of operations, demonstrates that a general purpose system is a good alternative to the previous supercomputer-based system or custom-designed hardware.},

abstract = {We report observations of Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) phase scintillations due to turbulence in the solar wind. The observations were made at 5.00 and 8.42 GHz with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) on three dates in 1991 July and August. We observed the sources 0851 + 202 and 0735+178 at solar elongations ranging from 2 degrees.66 to 13 degrees.29; the closest approach of the line of sight to the Sun ranged from 10 to 49.8 R(.). We have also included previously unpublished 5 GHz VLBI phase scintillation measurements from 1989. These measurements probe solar wind density fluctuations on spatial scales from about 200 km to 2000 km. Our measurements are in quite good agreement with the Coles {\&} Harmon model for the radio phase structure function, which was largely determined from observations on both shorter and larger spatial scales. Departures from the Coles {\&} Harmon functions are attributable to day-to-day variations in the solar wind conditions. Phase scintillations at the greatest solar elongations are in very good agreement with extrapolated estimates from direct measurements made with the Helios spacecraft at slightly larger heliocentric distances. Thus there is a consistency between the in situ spacecraft and radio remote sensing measurements of density turbulence. All of the VLBI data are consistent with a Kolmogorov spectrum for the density fluctuations, although at the closest elongations there may be excess power at small spatial scales. An advantage of interferometric techniques over other radio propagation measurements is that they provide a measure of the anisotropy of the irregularities. Our observations at closest approach (10 R,) show weak evidence for anisotropic, held-aligned density irregularities with an axial ratio of order 2. This degree of anisotropy would appear to be less than that measured at similar solar elongations but on smaller spatial scales by Armstrong and colleagues. Finally, a combination of the radio propagation data and in situ Hellos measurements is used to determine the heliocentric distance dependence of the normalization coefficient of the density power spectrum, C-N(2). Modeling C-N(2) proportional to (R/R(.))(-kappa), we find kappa = 3.72 +/- 0.30. Subject to a number of assumptions, this result is consistent with the conclusion of D. A. Roberts that turbulence within 0.28 astronomical units adheres to a WKB formula for turbulence amplitude as a function of heliocentric distance.},

It is designed to observe the largely unexplored frequency window from 10 to 85$\backslash$,MHz, offering a high sensitivity across its full bandwidth. NenuFAR has started its "early science" operation in July 2019, with 58$\backslash${\%} of its final collecting area being available. Pulsars are one of the major topics for the scientific exploitation of this frequency range and represent an important challenge in terms of instrumentation. Designing instrumentation at these frequencies is complicated by the need to compensate for the effects of both the interstellar medium and the ionosphere on the observed signal. Our real-time pipeline LUPPI (Low frequency Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrumentation) is able to cope with a high data rate and to provide real-time coherent de-dispersion down to the lowest frequencies reached by NenuFAR (10$\backslash$,MHz). The full backend functionality is described, as well as the main pulsar observing modes (folded, single-pulse, waveform, and dynamic spectrum). This instrumentation allowed us to detect 172 pulsars in our first targeted search below 85$\backslash$,MHz, including 10 millisecond pulsars (6 of which detected for the first time below 100 MHz).

The apparent source of the fundamental emission at 26.56MHz displaces away from the solar disk center at about 4 times the speed of light, while the apparent source of the harmonic emission at the same frequency shows a speed of {\textless} 0.02c. The source size of the harmonic emission, observed in this case, is smaller than that in previous studies, indicating the importance of the use of the remote baselines.},

Smerd, Wild and Sheridan have pointed out that the observed positions of type II bursts can be interpreted as favouring the backward emission of the second harmonic in a smooth corona. In this case the harmonic is seen after reflection from near the fundamental plasma level. Several other examples of type II and type III bursts have been reported which show this effect. We wish to present further evidence from a recent study of a large number of type III bursts observed with the 80 MHz heliograph and 158 MHz interferometer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Solar radio emission features a large number of fine structures demonstrating great variability in frequency and time. We present spatially resolved spectral radio observations of type IIIb bursts in the 30 – 80 MHz range made by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). The bursts show well-defined fine frequency structuring called “stria” bursts. The spatial characteristics of the stria sources are determined by the propagation effects of radio waves; their movement and expansion speeds are in the range of (0.1–0.6)c. Analysis of the dynamic spectra reveals that both the spectral bandwidth and the frequency drift rate of the striae increase with an increase of their central frequency. The striae bandwidths are in the range of ≈(20–100) kHz and the striae drift rates vary from zero to ≈0.3MHzs−1. The observed spectral characteristics of the stria bursts are consistent with the model involving modulation of the type III burst emission mechanism by small-amplitude fluctuations of the plasma density along the electron beam path. We estimate that the relative amplitude of the density fluctuations is of $\Delta$ n/ n∼ 10 − 3, their characteristic length scale is less than 1000 km, and the characteristic propagation speed is in the range of 400–800kms−1. These parameters indicate that the observed fine spectral structures could be produced by propagating magnetohydrodynamic waves.},

abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

Over the next few years, the SKA will make the transition from an early formative to a well-defined design. This paper outlines how the scientific challenges are translated into technical challenges, how the application of recent technology offers the potential of affordably meeting these challenges, and how the choices of technology will ultimately be made. The SKA will be an array of coherently connected antennas spread over an area about 3000 km in extent, with an aggregate antenna collecting area of up to 106 m {\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} at centimeter and meter wavelengths. A key scientific requirement is the ability to carry out sensitive observations of the sky over large areas (surveys). The survey speed of the SKA will be enabled by the application of the most up-to-date signal-processing technology available. The SKA science impact will be widely felt in astroparticle physics and cosmology, fundamental physics, galactic and extragalactic astronomy, solar system science, and astrobiology. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

It is applied on a two-dimensional interference mask after regular detection in the time-frequency domain with existing techniques. The scale-invariant rank (SIR) operator is defined, which is a one-dimensional mathematical morphology technique that can be used to find adjacent intervals in the time or frequency domain that are likely to be affected by RFI. The technique might also be applicable in other areas in which morphological scale-invariant behaviour is desired, such as source detection. A new algorithm is described, that is shown to perform quite well, has linear time complexity and is fast enough to be applied in modern high resolution observatories. It is used in the default pipeline of the LOFAR observatory.},

In single-frequency mode, the minor loop of our improved multi-scale algorithm is over an order of magnitude faster than the CASA multi-scale algorithm, and produces results of similar quality. For multi-frequency deconvolution, a technique named joined-channel cleaning is used. In this mode, the minor loop of our algorithm is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than CASA MSMFS. We extend the multi-scale mode with automated scale-dependent masking, which allows structures to be cleaned below the noise. We describe a new scale-bias function for use in multi-scale cleaning. We test a second deconvolution method that is a variant of the MORESANE deconvolution technique, and uses a convex optimisation technique with isotropic undecimated wavelets as dictionary. On simple, well calibrated data the convex optimisation algorithm produces visually more representative models. On complex or imperfect data, the convex optimisation algorithm has stability issues.},

In this review we remind the reader of the noticeable properties of these particles and of the stakes of the solar neutrino puzzle. The Standard Solar Model triggered persistent efforts in fundamental Physics to predict the solar neutrino fluxes, and its constantly evolving predictions have been regularly compared to the detected neutrino signals. Anticipating that this standard model could not reproduce the internal solar dynamics, a SEismic Solar Model was developed which enriched theoretical neutrino flux predictions with in situ observation of acoustic waves propagating in the Sun. This review reminds the historical steps, from the pioneering Homestake detection, the GALLEX- SAGE captures of the first pp neutrinos and emphasizes the importance of the Superkamiokande and SNO detectors to demonstrate that the solar-emitted electronic neutrinos are partially transformed into other neutrino flavors before reaching the Earth. The success of BOREXINO in detecting the 7 Be neutrino signal justifies the building of a new generation of detectors to measure the entire solar neutrino spectrum. A coherent picture emerged from neutrino physics and helioseismology. Today, new paradigms take shape: determining the masses of neutrinos and the research on the Sun is focusing on the dynamical aspects and on signature of dark matter. The third part of the review is dedicated to this prospect. The understanding of the crucial role of both rotation and magnetism in solar physics benefit from SoHO, SDO, and PICARD space observations. For now, the particle and stellar challenges seem decoupled, but this is only a superficial appearance. The development of asteroseismology shows the far-reaching impact of Neutrino and Stellar Astronomy.},

abstract = {A component of space weather, electron beams are routinely accelerated in the solar atmosphere and propagate through interplanetary space. Electron beams interact with Langmuir waves resulting in type III radio bursts. Electron beams expand along the trajectory, and using kinetic simulations, we explore the expansion as the electrons propagate away from the Sun. Specifically, we investigate the front, peak and back of the electron beam in space from derived radio brightness temperatures of fundamental type III emission. The front of the electron beams travelled at speeds from 0.2c--0.7c, significantly faster than the back of the beam that travelled between 0.12c--0.35c. The difference in speed between the front and the back elongates the electron beams in time. The rate of beam elongation has a 0.98 correlation coefficient with the peak velocity; in-line with predictions from type III observations. The inferred speeds of electron beams initially increase close to the acceleration region and then decrease through the solar corona. Larger starting densities and harder initial spectral indices result in longer and faster type III sources. Faster electron beams have higher beam energy densities, produce type IIIs with higher peak brightness temperatures and shorter FWHM durations. Higher background plasma temperatures also increase speeds, particularly at the back of the beam. We show how our predictions of electron beam evolution influences type III bandwidth and drift-rates. Our radial predictions of electron beam speed and expansion can be tested by the upcoming in situ electron beam measurements made by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe.},

abstract = {The Sun's activity leads to bursts of radio emission, among other phenomena. An example is type-III radio bursts. They occur frequently and appear as short-lived structures rapidly drifting from high to low frequencies in dynamic radio spectra. They are usually interpreted as signatures of beams of energetic electrons propagating along coronal magnetic field lines. Here we present novel interferometric LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) observations of three solar type-III radio bursts and their reverse bursts with high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution. They are consistent with a propagation of the radio sources along the coronal magnetic field lines with nonuniform speed. Hence, the type-III radio bursts cannot be generated by a monoenergetic electron beam, but by an ensemble of energetic electrons with a spread distribution in velocity and energy. Additionally, the density profile along the propagation path is derived in the corona. It agrees well with three-fold coronal density model by (1961, ApJ, 133, 983).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. Electromagnetic wave scattering off density inhomogeneities in the solar corona is an important process that determines both the apparent source size and the time profile of radio bursts observed at 1 au. Here we model the scattering process using a Fokker-Planck equation and apply this formalism to several regimes of interest. In the first regime the density fluctuations are considered quasi-static and diffusion in wavevector space is dominated by angular diffusion on the surface of a constant energy sphere. In the small-angle ("pencil-beam") approximation, this diffusion further occurs over a small solid angle in wavevector space. The second regime corresponds to a much later time, by which scattering has rendered the photon distribution near-isotropic, resulting in a spatial diffusion of the radiation. The third regime involves time-dependent fluctuations and, therefore, Fermi acceleration of photons. Combined, these results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework within which to understand several important features of propagation of radio burst waves in the solar corona: emitted photons are accelerated in a relatively small inner region and then diffuse outward to larger distances. En route, angular diffusion results both in source sizes that are substantially larger than the intrinsic source and in observed intensity-versus-time profiles that are asymmetric, with a sharp rise and an exponential decay. Both of these features are consistent with observations of solar radio bursts.},

PSR J0250+5854 was discovered by the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS), an all-Northern-sky survey for pulsars and fast transients at a central observing frequency of 135 MHz. We subsequently detected pulsations from the pulsar in the interferometric images of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, allowing for sub-arcsecond localization.

This also places the pulsar beyond the conventional pulsar death line, where radio emission is expected to cease. The spin period of PSR J0250+5854 is similar to those of the high-energy-emitting magnetars and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs). However, the pulsar was not detected by the Swift/XRT in the energy band of 0.3-10 keV, placing a bolometric luminosity limit of {\$}1.5 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}32{\}}{\$} erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for an assumed {\$}N{\_}{\{}\backslashrm H{\}}=1.35\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}21{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} and a temperature of 85 eV (typical of XDINSs).

In this paper, we have investigated the behavior of $\epsilon$N in the inner heliosphere from 0.26 to 0.82 AU. The density fluctuations $\Delta$N have been deduced using extensive ground-based observations of interplanetary scintillation at 327 MHz, which probe spatial scales of a few hundred kilometers. The background densities (N) have been derived using near-Earth observations from the Advanced Composition Explorer. Our analysis reveals that 0.001 ≲ $\epsilon$N ≲ 0.02 and does not vary appreciably with heliocentric distance. We also find that $\epsilon$N declines by 8{\%} from 1998 to 2008. We discuss the impact of these findings on problems ranging from our understanding of Forbush decreases to the behavior of the solar wind dynamic pressure over the recent peculiar solar minimum at the end of cycle 23.},

abstract = {The Sun is an active star that can launch large eruptions of magnetized plasma into the heliosphere, known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These can drive shocks that accelerate particles to high energies, often resulting in radio emission at low frequencies ({\textless}200 MHz). So far, the relationship between the expansion of CMEs, shocks and particle acceleration is not well understood, partly due to the lack of radio imaging at low frequencies during the onset of shock-producing CMEs. Here, we report multi-instrument radio, white-light and ultraviolet imaging of the second largest flare in solar cycle 24 (2008–present) and its associated fast CME (3,038 ± 288 km s −1 ). We identify the location of a multitude of radio shock signatures, called herringbones, and find evidence for shock-accelerated electron beams at multiple locations along the expanding CME. These observations support theories of non-uniform, rippled shock fronts driven by an expanding CME in the solar corona.},

abstract = {The LOw Frequency ARray-LOFAR-is a new radio interferometer designed with emphasis on flexible digital hardware instead of mechanical solutions. The array elements, so-called stations, are located in the Netherlands and in neighbouring countries. The design of LOFAR allows independent use of its international stations, which, coupled with a dedicated backend, makes them very powerful telescopes in their own right. This backend is called the Advanced Radio Transient Event Monitor and Identification System (ARTEMIS). It is a combined software/hardware solution for both targeted observations and real-time searches for millisecond radio transients which uses Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) technology to remove interstellar dispersion and detect millisecond radio bursts from astronomical sources in real-time. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Astronomical Union.},

abstract = {Solar Probe Plus (SPP) will be the first spacecraft to fly into the low solar corona. SPP's main science goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Understanding these fundamental phenomena has been a top-priority science goal for over five decades, dating back to the 1958 Simpson Committee Report. The scale and concept of such a mission has been revised at intervals since that time, yet the core has always been a close encounter with the Sun. The mission design and the technology and engineering developments enable SPP to meet its science objectives to: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The SPP mission was confirmed in March 2014 and is under development as a part of NASA's Living with a Star (LWS) Program. SPP is scheduled for launch in mid-2018, and will perform 24 orbits over a 7-year nominal mission duration. Seven Venus gravity assists gradually reduce SPP's perihelion from 35 solar radii (RS) for the first orbit to {\textless}10RS for the final three orbits. In this paper we present the science, mission concept and the baseline vehicle for SPP, and examine how the mission will address the key science questions},

abstract = {We present Very Large Array observations at wavelengths of 2, 3.5, 6, and 20 cm, of angular broadening of radio sources due to the solar wind in the region 2-16 solar radii. Angular broadening is anisotropic with axial ratios in the range 2-16. Larger axial ratios are observed preferentially at smaller solar distances. Assuming that anisotropy is due to scattering blobs elongated along magnetic field lines, the distribution of position angles of the elliptically broadened images indicates that the field lines are non-radial even at the largest heliocentric distances observed here. At 5R⊙, the major axis scattering angle is ∼ 0.7" at $\lambda$= 6 cm and it varies with heliocentric distance as R-1.6. The level of turbulence, characterized by the wave structure function at a scale of 10 km along the major axis, normalized to $\lambda$ = 20 cm, has a value 20 ± 7 at 5R⊙and varies with heliocentric distance as R-3. Comparison with earlier resu lts suggest that the level of turbulence is higher during solar maximum. Assuming a power-law spectrum of electron density fluctuations, the fitted spectral exponents have values in the range 2.8-3.4 for scale sizes between 2-35 km. The data suggests temporal fluctuations (of up to 10{\%}) in the spectral exponent on a time scale of a few tens of minutes. The observed structure functions at different solar distances do not show any evidence for an inner scale; the upper limits are l k m at 2 R⊙ and 4 km at 13 R⊙. These upper limits are in conflict with earlier determinations and may suggest a reduced inner scale during solar maximum. {\textcopyright} 1994 Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {Abstract The magnetic energy stored in the corona is the only plausible source for the energy released during large solar flares. During the last 20 years most theoretical work has concentrated on models which store magnetic energy in the corona in the form of electrical currents, and a major goal of present day research is to understand how these currents are created, and then later dissipated during a flare. Another important goal is to find a flare model which can eject magnetic flux into interplanetary space. Although many flares do not eject magnetic flux, those which do are of special importance for solar-terrestrial relations since the ejected flux can have dramatic effects if it hits the Earth's magnetosphere. Three flare models which have been extensively investigated are the emerging-flux model, the sheared-arcade model, and the magnetic-flux-rope model. All of these models can store and release magnetic energy efficiently provided that rapid magnetic reconnection occurs. However, only the magne...},

abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

This is a subset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed with a 0.76 kHz/1 s resolution.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We measured the RFI occupancy in the low and high frequency sets to be 1.8{\%} and 3.2{\%} respectively. These values are found to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day and night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find that lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR results in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of 0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5{\%}. This rate increases approximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR radio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It remains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that integrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for the low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR; accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the proximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be used once low-level RFI starts to become apparent. It is important that the frequency range of LOFAR remains free of broadband interference, such as DAB stations and windmills.},

abstract = {CNN-based optical flow estimation has attracted attention recently, mainly due to its impressively high frame rates. These networks perform well on synthetic datasets, but they are still far behind the classical methods in real-world videos. This is because there is no ground truth optical flow for training these networks on real data. In this paper, we boost CNN-based optical flow estimation in real scenes with the help of the freely available self-supervised task of next-frame prediction. To this end, we train the network in a hybrid way, providing it with a mixture of synthetic and real videos. With the help of a sample-variant multi-tasking architecture, the network is trained on different tasks depending on the availability of ground-truth. We also experiment with the prediction of "next-flow" instead of estimation of the current flow, which is intuitively closer to the task of next-frame prediction and yields favorable results. We demonstrate the improvement in optical flow estimation on the real-world KITTI benchmark. Additionally, we test the optical flow indirectly in an action classification scenario. As a side product of this work, we report significant improvements over state-of-the-art in the task of next-frame prediction.},

abstract = {Solar flare accelerated electron beams propagating away from the Sun can interact with the turbulent interplanetary media, producing plasma waves and Type III radio emission. These electron beams are detected near the Earth with a double power-law energy spectrum.We simulate electron beam propagation from the Sun to the Earth in the weak turbulent regime taking into account the self-consistent generation of plasmawaves and subsequent wave interaction with density fluctuations from low-frequency MHD turbulence. The rate at which plasma waves are induced by an unstable electron beam is reduced by background density fluctuations, most acutely when fluctuations have large amplitudes or small wavelengths. This suppression of plasma waves alters the wave distribution which changes the electron beam transport. Assuming a 5/3 Kolmogorov-type power-density spectrum of fluctuations often observed near the Earth, we investigate the corresponding energy spectrum of the electron beam after it has propagated 1 AU. We find a direct correlation between the spectrum of the double power-law below the break energy and the turbulent intensity of the background plasma. For an initial spectral index of 3.5, we find a range of spectra below the break energy between 1.6 and 2.1, with higher levels of turbulence corresponding to higher spectral indices. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {Quiet sun meterwave emission arises from thermal bremsstrahlung in the MK corona, and can potentially be a rich source of coronal diagnostics. On its way to the observer, it gets modified substantially due to the propagation effects - primarily refraction and scattering - through the magnetized and turbulent coronal medium, leading to the redistribution of the intensity in the image plane. By comparing the full-disk meterwave solar maps during a quiet solar period and the modelled thermal bremsstrahlung emission, we characterise these propagation effects. The solar radio maps between 100 and 240 MHz come from the Murchison Widefield Array. FORWARD package is used to simulate thermal bremsstrahlung images using the self-consistent Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere coronal model. The FORWARD model does not include propagation effects. The differences between the observed and modelled maps are interpreted to arise due to scattering and refraction. There is a good general correspondence between the predicted and observed brightness distributions, though significant differences are also observed. We find clear evidence for the presence of significant propagation effects, including anisotropic scattering. The observed radio size of the Sun is 25--30$\backslash${\%} larger in area. The emission peak corresponding to the only visible active region shifts by 8'--11' and its size increases by 35--40$\backslash${\%}. Our simple models suggest that the fraction of scattered flux density is always larger than a few tens of percent, and varies significantly between different regions. We estimate density inhomogeneities to be in the range 1--10$\backslash${\%}.},

These deconvolution algorithms find an estimate of the true sky brightness from the necessarily incomplete sampled visibility data. The most widely used radio synthesis deconvolution method is the CLEAN algorithm of H{\"{o}}gbom. This algorithm works extremely well for collections of point sources and surprisingly well for extended objects. However, the performance for extended objects can be improved by adopting a multiscale approach. We describe and demonstrate a conceptually simple and algorithmically straightforward extension to CLEAN that models the sky brightness by the summation of components of emission having different size scales. While previous multiscale algorithms work sequentially on decreasing scale sizes, our algorithm works simultaneously on a range of specified scales. Applications to both real and simulated data sets are given. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Since its formulation by Hamaker et al., the radio interferometer measurement equation (RIME) has provided a rigorous mathematical basis for the development of novel calibration methods and techniques, including various approaches to the problem of direction-dependent effects (DDEs). However, acceptance of the RIME in the radio astronomical community at large has been slow, which is partially due to the limited availability of software to exploit its power, and the sparsity of practical results. This needs to change urgently.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} This series of papers aims to place recent developments in the treatment of DDEs into one RIME-based mathematical framework, and to demonstrate the ease with which the various effects can be described and understood. It also aims to show the benefits of a RIME-based approach to calibration. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Paper I re-derives the RIME from first principles, extends the formalism to the full-sky case, and incorporates DDEs. Paper II then uses the formalism to describe self-calibration, both with a full RIME, and with the approximate equations of older software packages, and shows how this is affected by DDEs. It also gives an overview of real-life DDEs and proposed methods of dealing with them. Finally, in Paper III some of these methods are exercised to achieve an extremely high-dynamic range calibration of WSRT observations of 3C 147 at 21 cm, with full treatment of DDEs.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The RIME formalism is extended to the full-sky case (Paper I), and is shown to be an elegant way of describing calibration and DDEs (Paper II). Applying this to WSRT data (Paper III) results in a noise-limited image of the field around 3C 147 with a very high dynamic range (1.6 million), and none of the off-axis artifacts that plague regular selfcal. The resulting differential gain solutions contain significant information on DDEs and errors in the sky model.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The RIME is a powerful formalism for describing radio interferometry, and underpins the development of novel calibration methods, in particular those dealing with DDEs. One of these is the differential gains approach used for the 3C 147 reduction. Differential gains can eliminate DDE-related artifacts, and provide information for iterative improvements of sky models. Perhaps most importantly, sources as faint as 2 mJy have been shown to yield meaningful differential gain solutions, and thus can be used as potential calibration beacons in other DDE-related schemes.},

The purpose of this paper is to convey both an intuitive feel and the mathematical basis for this imaging process. Following a review of the relevant hardware, the imaging principles and the basic back-projection method are described, along with their relation to Fourier transforms. Several specific algorithms (Clean, MEM, Pixons and Forward-Fitting) applicable to RHESSI imaging are briefly described.

abstract = {Context. Radio U-bursts and J-bursts are signatures of electron beams propagating along magnetic loops confined to the corona. The more commonly observed type III radio bursts are signatures of electron beams propagating along magnetic loops that extend into interplanetary space. Given the prevalence of solar magnetic flux to be closed in the corona, why type III bursts are more frequently observed than U-bursts or J-bursts is an outstanding question. Aims. We use Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) imaging spectroscopy between 30-80 MHz of low-frequency U-bursts and J-bursts, for the first time, to understand why electron beams travelling along coronal loops produce radio emission less often. Radio burst observations provide information not only about the exciting electron beams but also about the structure of large coronal loops with densities that are too low for standard extreme ultraviolet (EUV) or X-ray analysis. Methods. We analysed LOFAR images of a sequence of two J-bursts and one U-burst. The different radio source positions were used to model the spatial structure of the guiding magnetic flux tube and then deduce the energy range of the exciting electron beams without the assumption of a standard density model. We also estimated the electron density along the magnetic flux rope and compared it to coronal models. Results. The radio sources infer a magnetic loop that is 1 solar radius in altitude with the highest frequency sources starting around 0.6 solar radii. Electron velocities were found between 0.13 c and 0.24 c with the front of the electron beam travelling faster than the back of the electron beam. The velocities correspond to energy ranges within the beam from 0.7-11 keV to 0.7-43 keV. The density along the loop is higher than typical coronal density models and the density gradient is smaller. Conclusions. We found that a more restrictive range of accelerated beam and background plasma parameters can result in U-bursts or J-bursts, causing type III bursts to be more frequently observed. The large instability distances required before Langmuir waves are produced by some electron beams, and the small magnitude of the background density gradients makes closed loops less facilitative for radio emission than loops that extend into interplanetary space.},

abstract = {Context. Solar activity is often accompanied by solar radio emission, consisting of numerous types of solar radio bursts. At low frequencies ({\textless}100 MHz) radio bursts with short durations of milliseconds, such as solar S-bursts, have been identified. To date, their origin and many of their characteristics remain unclear. Aims. We report observations from the Ukrainian T-shaped Radio telescope, (UTR-2), and the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) which give us new insight into their nature. Methods. Over 3000 S-bursts were observed on 9 July 2013 at frequencies of 17.4-83.1 MHz during a period of low solar activity. Leading models of S-burst generation were tested by analysing the spectral properties of S-bursts and estimating coronal magnetic field strengths. Results. S-bursts were found to have short durations of 0.5-0.9 s. Multiple instruments were used to measure the dependence of drift rate on frequency which is represented by a power law with an index of 1.57. For the first time, we show a linear relation between instantaneous bandwidth and frequency over a wide frequency band. The flux calibration and high sensitivity of UTR-2 enabled measurements of their fluxes, which yielded 11+3 SFU. The source particle velocities of S-bursts were found to be {\~{}}0.07 c. S-burst source heights were found to range from 1.3 R{\_}Sun to 2 R{\_}Sun. Furthermore, a contemporary theoretical model of S-burst generation was used to conduct remote sensing of the coronal magnetic field at these heights which yielded values of 0.9-5.8 G. Within error, these values are comparable to those predicted by various relations between magnetic field strength and height in the corona.},

abstract = {This paper will review the input of 65 years of radio observations to our understanding of solar and solar-terrestrial physics. It is focussed on the radio observations of phenomena linked to solar activity in the period going from the first discovery of the radio emissions to present days. We shall present first an overview of solar radio physics focussed on the active Sun and on the premices of solar-terrestrial relationships from the discovery to the 1980s. We shall then discuss the input of radioastronomy both at metric/decimetric wavelengths and at centimetric/millimetric and submillimetric wavelengths to our understanding of flares. We shall also review some of the radio, X-ray and white-light signatures bringing new evidence for reconnection and current sheets in eruptive events. The input of radio images (obtained with a high temporal cadence) to the understanding of the initiation and fast development in the low corona of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as well as the radio observations of shocks in the corona and in the interplanetary medium will be reviewed. The input of radio observations to our knowledge of the interplanetary magnetic structures (ICMEs) will be summarized; we shall show how radio observations linked to the propagation of electron beams allow to identify small scale structures in the heliosphere and to trace the connection between the Sun and interplanetary structures as far as 4AU. We shall also describe how the radio observations bring useful information on the relationship and connections between the energetic electrons in the corona and the electrons measured in-situ. The input of radio observations on the forecasting of the arrival time of shocks at the Earth as well as on Space Weather studies will be described. In the last section, we shall summarize the key results that have contributed to transform our knowledge of solar activity and its link with the interplanetary medium. In conclusion, we shall indicate the instrumental radio developments at Earth and in space, which are from our point of view, necessary for the future of solar and interplanetary physics. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

These shocks may be associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and reach speeds higher than the local magnetosonic speed. Radio imaging of decameter wavelengths (20–90 MHz) is now possible with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), opening a new radio window in which to study coronal shocks that leave the inner solar corona and enter the interplanetary medium and to understand their association with CMEs.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} To this end, we study a coronal shock associated with a CME and type II radio burst to determine the locations at which the radio emission is generated, and we investigate the origin of the band-splitting phenomenon.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Thetype II shock source-positions and spectra were obtained using 91 simultaneous tied-array beams of LOFAR, and the CME was observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and by the COR2A coronagraph of the SECCHI instruments on board the Solar Terrestrial Relation Observatory(STEREO). The 3D structure was inferred using triangulation of the coronographic observations.

The type II radio burst showed first and second harmonic emission; the second harmonic source was cospatial with the first harmonic source to within the observational uncertainty. This suggests that radio wave propagation does not alter the apparent location of the harmonic source. The sources of the two split bands were also found to be cospatial within the observational uncertainty, in agreement with the interpretation that split bands are simultaneous radio emission from upstream and downstream of the shock front. The fast magnetosonic Mach number derived from this interpretation was found to lie in the range 1.3–1.5. The fast magnetosonic Mach numbers derived from modelling the CME and the coronal magnetic field around the type II source were found to lie in the range 1.4–1.6.},

The instrument operates in the frequency range of {\~{}}10-240 MHz and is used for a variety of astrophysical science cases. While it is not heliophysics or space weather dedicated, a new project entitled "LOFAR for Space Weather"(LOFAR4SW) aims at designing a system upgrade to allow the entire array to observe the Sun, heliosphere, Earth's ionosphere, and Jupiter throughout its observing window. This will allow the instrument to operate as a space weather observing platform, facilitating both space weather science and operations. Part of this design study aims to survey the existing space weather infrastructure operating at radio frequencies and show how LOFAR4SW can advance the current state-of-the-art in this field. In this paper, we survey radio instrumentation and facilities that currently operate in space weather science and/or operations, including instruments involved in solar, heliospheric, and ionospheric studies. We furthermore include an overview of the major space weather service providers in operation today and the current state-of-the-art in the radio data they use and provide routinely. The aim is to compare LOFAR4SW to the existing radio research infrastructure in space weather and show how it may advance both space weather science and operations in the radio domain in the near future.},

abstract = {Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are millisecond radio signals that exhibit dispersion larger than what the Galactic electron density can account for. We have conducted a 1446 hour survey for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at 145{\~{}}MHz, covering a total of 4193 sq. deg on the sky. We used the UK station of the LOFAR radio telescope -- the Rawlings Array -- , accompanied for a majority of the time by the LOFAR station at Nan$\backslash$c{\{}c{\}}ay, observing the same fields at the same frequency. Our real-time search backend, ARTEMIS, utilizes graphics processing units to search for pulses with dispersion measures up to 320 cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} pc. Previous derived FRB rates from surveys around 1.4{\~{}}GHz, and favoured FRB interpretations, motivated this survey, despite all previous detections occurring at higher dispersion measures. We detected no new FRBs above a signal-to-noise threshold of 10, leading to the most stringent upper limit yet on the FRB event rate at these frequencies: 29 sky{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} day{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for 5{\~{}}ms-duration pulses above 62{\~{}}Jy. The non-detection could be due to scatter-broadening, limitations on the volume and time searched, or the shape of FRB flux density spectra. Assuming the latter and that FRBs are standard candles, the non-detection is compatible with the published FRB sky rate, if their spectra follow a power law with frequency ({\$}\backslashpropto \backslashnu{\^{}}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$}), with {\$}\backslashalpha\backslashgtrsim+0.1{\$}, demonstrating a marked difference from pulsar spectra. Our results suggest that surveys at higher frequencies, including the low frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array, will have better chances to detect, estimate rates and understand the origin and properties of FRBs.},

abstract = {Context. Solar type III radio bursts contain a wealth of information about the dynamics of electron beams in the solar corona and the inner heliosphere; this information is currently unobtainable through other means. However, the motion of different regions of an electron beam (front, middle, and back) have never been systematically analysed before.Aims. We characterise the type III burst frequency-time evolution using the enhanced resolution of LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) in the frequency range 30–70 MHz and use this to probe electron beam dynamics.Methods. The rise, peak, and decay times with a {\~{}}0.2 MHz spectral resolution were defined for a collection of 31 type III bursts. The frequency evolution was used to ascertain the apparent velocities of the front, middle, and back of the type III sources, and the trends were interpreted using theoretical and numerical treatments.Results. The type III time profile was better approximated by an asymmetric Gaussian profile and not an exponential, as was used previously. Rise and decay times increased with decreasing frequency and showed a strong correlation. Durations were shorter than previously observed. Drift rates from the rise times were faster than from the decay times, corresponding to inferred mean electron beam speeds for the front, middle, and back of 0.2, 0.17, 0.15 c, respectively. Faster beam speeds correlate with shorter type III durations. We also find that the type III frequency bandwidth decreases as frequency decreases.Conclusions. The different speeds naturally explain the elongation of an electron beam in space as it propagates through the heliosphere. The expansion rate is proportional to the mean speed of the exciter; faster beams expand faster. Beam speeds are attributed to varying ensembles of electron energies at the front, middle, and back of the beam.},

abstract = {The Nan$\backslash$c{\{}c{\}}ay Radioheliograph (NRH) routinely produces snapshot images of the full sun at frequencies between 150 and 450 MHz, with typical resolution 3 arcmin and time cadence 0.2 s. Combining visibilities from the NRH and from the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) allows us to produce images of the sun at 236 or 327 MHz, with a large FOV, high resolution and time cadence. We seek to investigate the structure of noise storms (the most common non-thermal solar radio emission). We focus on the relation of position and altitude of noise storms with the observing frequency and on the lower limit of their sizes. We present results for noise storms on four days. The results consist of an extended halo and of one or several compact cores with relative intensity changing over a few seconds. We found that core sizes can be almost stable over one hour, with a minimum in the range 31-35 arcsec (less than previously reported) and can be stable over one hour. The heliocentric distances of noise storms are {\$}\backslashsim 1.20{\$} and 1.35 {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} at 432 and 150 MHz, respectively. Regions where storms originate are thus much denser than the ambient corona and their vertical extent is found to be less than expected from hydrostatic equilibrium. The smallest observed sizes impose upper limits on broadening effects due to scattering on density inhomogeneities in the low and medium corona and constrain the level of density turbulence in the solar corona. It is possible that scatter broadening has been overestimated in the past, and that the observed sizes cannot only be attributed to scattering. The vertical structure of the noise storms is difficult to reconcile with the classical columnar model.},

abstract = {Solar radio observations provide a unique diagnostic of the outer solar atmosphere. However, the inhomogeneous turbulent corona strongly affects the propagation of the emitted radio waves, so decoupling the intrinsic properties of the emitting source from the effects of radio wave propagation has long been a major challenge in solar physics. Here we report quantitative spatial and frequency characterization of solar radio burst fine structures observed with the Low Frequency Array, an instrument with high-time resolution that also permits imaging at scales much shorter than those corresponding to radio wave propagation in the corona. The observations demonstrate that radio wave propagation effects, and not the properties of the intrinsic emission source, dominate the observed spatial characteristics of radio burst images. These results permit more accurate estimates of source brightness temperatures, and open opportunities for quantitative study of the mechanisms that create the turbulent coronal medium through which the emitted radiation propagates.},

Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.},

abstract = {Recent radio wave interplanetary scintillation observations have improved our knowledge of the level of turbulent fluctuations of plasma density in the inner solar wind at heliocentric distances of 16-26 R-. and less accurately outside this range. This information relates to fluctuations in the inertial subrange of the turbulence. Of particular concern in this paper is the heliocentric distance dependence of the power-law normalization parameter C-N(2). This measurement of C-N(2), when combined with independent measurements of the mean plasma density in the inner solar wind, indicates that the dimensionless amplitude of the turbulence epsilon = sigma(n)/(n) over bar is low, of the order of 6{\%}-15{\%}, where sigma(n) is the standard deviation of the density fluctuations and (n) over bar is the mean value. The deduced value for epsilon depends on an assumed value for the outer scale of the turbulence, l(o). I adopt a fiducial value of l(o) = 1 R-.. A comparison is made with independent estimates of epsilon, from both radio remote sensing in the same part of space and in situ measurements at greater distances. Satisfactory agreement occurs. I discuss the possibility that this dimensionless density amplitude epsilon might be a proxy for the corresponding amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuations. This is a controversial assertion. However, if it is the case, the measurements suggest that the turbulence in the inner solar wind is weak, in the sense of being dynamically and thermodynamically important.},

abstract = {The amplitude of density turbulence in the extended solar corona, especially near the dissipation scale, impinges on several problems of current interest. Radio sources observed through the turbulent solar wind are broadened due to refraction by and scattering off density inhomogeneities, and observations of scatter broadening are often employed to constrain the turbulence amplitude. The extent of such scatter broadening is usually computed using the structure function, which gives ameasure of the spatial correlationmeasured by an interferometer. Most such treatments have employed analytical approximations to the structure function that are valid in the asymptotic limits s ≫ li or s ≪ li, where s is the interferometer spacing and li is the inner scale of the density turbulence spectrum. We instead use a general structure function (GSF) that straddles these regimes, and quantify the errors introduced by the use of these approximations.We have included the effects of anisotropic scattering for distant cosmic sources viewed through the solar wind at small elongations. We show that the regimes where the GSF predictions are more accurate than those of the asymptotic expressions are not only of practical relevance, but are where inner scale effects influence estimates of scatter broadening. Taken together, we argue that the GSF should henceforth be used for scatter broadening calculations and estimates of turbulence amplitudes in the solar corona and solar wind.},

abstract = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale magnetized plasma structures ejected from closed magnetic field regions of the Sun. White light coronagraphic observations from ground and space have provided extensive information on CMEs in the outer corona. However, our understanding of the solar origin and early life of CMEs is still in an elementary stage because of lack of adequate observations. Recent space missions such as Yohkoh and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and ground-based radioheliographs at Nobeyama and Nancay have accumulated a wealth of information on the manifestations of CMEs near the solar surface. We review some of these observations in an attempt to relate them to what we already know about CMEs. Our discussion relies heavily on non-coronagraphic data combined with coronagraphic data. Specifically, we discuss the following aspects of CMEs: (i) coronal dimming and global disk signatures, (ii) non-radial propagation during the early phase, (iii) Photospheric magnetic field changes during CMEs, and (iv) acceleration of fast CMEs. The relative positions and evolution of coronal dimming, arcade formation, prominence eruption will be discussed using specific events. The magnitude and spatial extent of CME acceleration may be an important parameter that distinguishes fast and slow CMEs.},

Here, we study the evolution of fully developed turbulence associated with the slow solar wind along the PSP trajectory between 35.55 R{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and 131.64 R{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} in the outbound direction, comparing observations to a theoretical turbulence transport model. Several turbulent quantities, such as the fluctuating kinetic energy and the corresponding correlation length, the variance of density fluctuations, and the solar wind proton temperature are determined from the PSP SWEAP plasma data along its trajectory between 35.55 R{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and 131.64 R{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. The evolution of the PSP derived turbulent quantities are compared to the numerical solutions of the nearly incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (NI MHD) turbulence transport model recently developed by Zank et al. (2017). We find reasonable agreement between the theoretical and observed results. On the basis of these comparisons, we derive other theoretical turbulent quantities, such as the energy in forward and backward propagating modes, the total turbulent energy, the normalized residual energy and cross-helicity, the fluctuating magnetic energy, and the correlation lengths corresponding to forward and backward propagating modes, the residual energy, and the fluctuating magnetic energy.},

abstract = {The Sun is an active star that can launch large eruptions of magnetized plasma into the heliosphere, known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These can drive shocks that accelerate particles to high energies, often resulting in radio emission at low frequencies ({\textless}200 MHz). So far, the relationship between the expansion of CMEs, shocks and particle acceleration is not well understood, partly due to the lack of radio imaging at low frequencies during the onset of shock-producing CMEs. Here, we report multi-instrument radio, white-light and ultraviolet imaging of the second largest flare in solar cycle 24 (2008–present) and its associated fast CME (3,038 ± 288 km s −1 ). We identify the location of a multitude of radio shock signatures, called herringbones, and find evidence for shock-accelerated electron beams at multiple locations along the expanding CME. These observations support theories of non-uniform, rippled shock fronts driven by an expanding CME in the solar corona.},

The non-detection could be due to scatter-broadening, limitations on the volume and time searched, or the shape of FRB flux density spectra.

abstract = {LOFAR, the LOw-Frequency ARray, is a new-generation radio interferometer constructed in the north of the Netherlands and across europe. Utilizing a novel phased-array design, LOFAR covers the largely unexplored low-frequency range from 10-240 MHz and provides a number of unique observing capabilities. Spreading out from a core located near the village of Exloo in the northeast of the Netherlands, a total of 40 LOFAR stations are nearing completion. A further five stations have been deployed throughout Germany, and one station has been built in each of France, Sweden, and the UK. Digital beam-forming techniques make the LOFAR system agile and allow for rapid repointing of the telescope as well as the potential for multiple simultaneous observations. With its dense core array and long interferometric baselines, LOFAR achieves unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution in the low-frequency radio regime. The LOFAR facilities are jointly operated by the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) foundation, as an observatory open to the global astronomical community. LOFAR is one of the first radio observatories to feature automated processing pipelines to deliver fully calibrated science products to its user community. LOFAR's new capabilities, techniques and modus operandi make it an important pathfinder for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We give an overview of the LOFAR instrument, its major hardware and software components, and the core science objectives that have driven its design. In addition, we present a selection of new results from the commissioning phase of this new radio observatory.},

@article{Offringa2012,
abstract = {Aims: This paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radio astronomy with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), with a focus on imaging observations. Methods: We have analysed the radio-frequency interference (RFI) situation in two 24-h surveys with Dutch LOFAR stations, covering 30-78 MHz with low-band antennas and 115-163 MHz with high-band antennas. This is a subset of the full frequency range of LOFAR. The surveys have been observed with a 0.76 kHz / 1 s resolution. Results: We measured the RFI occupancy in the low and high frequency sets to be 1.8{\%} and 3.2{\%} respectively. These values are found to be representative values for the LOFAR radio environment. Between day and night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. We find that lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of LOFAR results in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. At LOFAR's nominal resolution of 0.76 kHz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5{\%}. This rate increases approximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution. Conclusions: Currently, by using an automated RFI detection strategy, the LOFAR radio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. It remains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations that integrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. Reasons for the low impact of RFI are the high spectral and time resolution of LOFAR; accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and the proximity of the antennas to the ground. We discuss some strategies that can be used once low-level RFI starts to become apparent. It is important that the frequency range of LOFAR remains free of broadband interference, such as DAB stations and windmills.},
