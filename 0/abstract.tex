The solar corona is the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere. Advancements in radio astronomy over the last 50 years have revealed a number of radio phenomena which occur in the corona each with different temporal and spectral characteristics. Current generation interferometers such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) give an unprecedented insight into the fine spatial, spectral and temporal structure of these radio bursts. Of particular interest are what are known as Type III radio bursts, which are indicative of electrons being accelerated along open magnetic field lines in the solar corona. Due to the relation between emission at the plasma frequency and electron density, observations of Type III bursts allow for the remote sensing of the plasma at various heights in the corona. High spatial resolution observations of radio bursts give insight into the role of radio wave scattering on the observed source sizes while high temporal and spectral resolution observations can be used to determine the power density of electron density fluctuations in the corona.

Key results of this thesis come from observations of solar radio emission at the highest temporal, spectral and spatial resolutions to date. Firstly, the REAL-time Transient Acquisition backend (REALTA) was developed and installed at the Irish LOFAR station (I-LOFAR) to record the raw voltages from the station at $5.12 \mu$s temporal resolution. Some first light observations of solar radio burst are shown.

Secondly, a new technique was implemented for the first time to directly measure the size of radio bursts from their interferometric visibilities. For a burst at 34.76~MHz, the full width at half maximum height (FWHM) along the major and minor axes is found to be $18.8$~$\pm~0.1$ arcmin and $10.2$~$\pm~0.1$ arcmin respectively at a plane of sky heliocentric distance of 1.75~R$_\odot$. These results suggest that the level of density fluctuations in the solar corona  is  the  major  cause  of  the  scattering  of  radio  waves, resulting in  large  source  sizes.

This technique was utilised to determine the size and shape of 30 Type III bursts that were compared with predictions from state-of-the-art scattering simulations. It is found that these bursts have a mean size along the major and minor axis of FWHM\textsubscript{x} = 16.27 arcmin and FWHM\textsubscript{y} = 11.96 arcmin respectively. No trend of source size with respect to helioprojective angle is found, which is in direct contrast to predictions from modelling of anisotropic scattering from a point source.

I highlight some future work that could be built upon the research presented in this thesis to further advance the knowledge of radio wave generation and propagation in the solar corona.


%High temporal resolution data allow the study of rapid temporal variability in radio spectra which are indicative of small-scale turbulence in the solar corona. It is thought that the density inhomogeneities produced by this small-scale turbulence causes scattering of radio waves as they propagate out from the corona and thus pose a fundamental limit on the source size of observed radio bursts. Analysis of radio bursts at the plasma frequency, such as a Type III burst, with highly spatially resolved interferometric data is the most direct way of testing this hypothesis.
%Particularly bright radio bursts can have devastating effects on terrestrial communication including GPS positioning and satellite communication. Given that much of modern society relies on satellite communication, being better able to understand and perhaps predict radio bursts is essential.

% and is one of the fundamental pieces of this PhD. Following this, exploratory work with 5 ns temporal resolution data from the Irish LOFAR station (I-LOFAR) to delve further into the small-scale variations with time in the solar corona will be undertaken.

%	The nature of this PhD is twofold, firstly to observe low frequency radio emission from the Sun at spatial resolution of the order of 15 arcseconds. This will determine whether or not scattering of radio waves in the corona imposes a fundamental limit on spatial resolution and give insight into the processes that might cause this limit. The second aspect of this PhD is to observe the Sun at radio wavelengths at the highest temporal resolution ever. In order to do this, the TBB Acquisition Cluster (TACl) located in the I-LOFAR control room must be further developed to record and store TBB data without corruption. Observing the Sun at nanosecond temporal resolution has yet to be attempted and as such the potential to discover new radio phenomena and temporal variability in existing phenomena is great. It is, of course, possible that such events do not occur or are difficult to detect and as such the focus for this PhD will lie mainly on interferometric observations of the Sun.

%The goal for this project is to study known radio phenomena at nanosecond resolution in order to discover new temporal variability, if this exists, and new sub-microsecond radio bursts if they exist. In order to do this a computer cluster dedicated to the recording and storage of such data, which is real, must be further developed

%This report is an overview of my PhD thus far and is as follows. Chapter \ref{chap:intro} describes the Sun and the corona. It introduces the role radio bursts have to play in determining source sizes in the corona and outlines the theory behind plasma emission, radio interferometry and beam-forming. Chapter \ref{chap:inst} gives a technical description of LOFAR, its hardware and the digital signal processing pipeline of an international LOFAR station. Observations using high temporal resolution data from I-LOFAR are explained in chapter \ref{chap:obs} along with interferometric images from the core and remote LOFAR stations. The results of analysis of this data is also given in chapter \ref{chap:obs} before the report is concluded in \ref{chap:conc}. Future work for this PhD is outlined in chapter \ref{chap:future}.
