\chapter{Observations of Radio Scattering in the Solar Corona compared to Computational Modelling.}
\label{chap:observations_vs_theory}
In this chapter I utilise the direct visibility fitting method described in Chapter \ref{chap:measuring_source_sizes} and apply it to hundreds of type III radio bursts. I showcase the striking similarity/difference between these observations and computational modelling.
