October 2018Summary
The activity of the Sun, our closest star, has an immense impact on our daily lives.
Violent solar storms can regularly be observed on Earth most notably as aurorae or
disruptions to telecommunications and power grids. With so many modern advance-
ments in technology being satellite dependent, the importance and necessity of solar
physics research comes into focus. The fact that solar activity is often accompanied by
bursts of radiation observable at radio frequencies gives us the opportunity to better
understand these phenomena.
In recent years, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) have de-
veloped an international network of radio telescopes called the LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR). LOFAR operates between 10 and 240 MHz and extends over 2,000km across
Europe. This makes it the perfect instrument to observe the Sun and its activity.
The goals of this PhD have been divided into three separate work packages. The
first work package was the installation and operation of the Irish LOFAR station, I-
LOFAR. The construction and integration of I-LOFAR was completed in September
2017. Operation and maintenance of the station is still ongoing and will continue
throughout the duration of this PhD.
However, this report will focus on second and third work packages of my Phd namely;
the development of a Solar Imaging Pipeline and the assembly and analysis of a survey
of small-scale structure in the solar corona. The development of interferometric imaging
software began with the analysis of a solar eclipse observed by LOFAR on the 20 March
2015. This report explains the approach taken in the pre-processing, calibration and
CLEANing of this data. The use of this interferometric data has provided angular
resolution capable of probing the atmosphere to arcminute resolution. Via the analysis
of these small-scale features in the corona we hope to understand better the effects
of scattering at low frequencies. However, the fact that this observation is an eclipse
gives it the special ability to achieve resolutions beyond what is possible using an
interferometer. The lunar limb acts as a knife-edge, setting up a diffraction pattern
that has the potential to reveal sub-arcminute structure in the corona. This work will
be continued by applying the imaging techniques learned to other observations with
longer baselines to build up a survey of small-scale structure in the corona at different
frequencies.This report opens in Chapter 1 with an introduction to the Sun and the solar corona.
This chapter continues with a description of the Sun in the radio regime of the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum, paying particular attention to the significance of small-scale
structure as well as radio emission mechanisms and then concludes with an explana-
tion of radio interferometry. Following on, Chapter 2, details the instrument used for
these observations, LOFAR. The solar eclipse event of the 20 March 2015 is described
in Chapter 3 which begins with an insight into the solar conditions at the time, followed
by a summary of LOFAR’s observing campaign. The rest of Chapter 3 focuses on the
analysis of the data, including the calibration, deconvolution and an investigation of
different CLEAN parameters. The results of this study are summarised in Chapter 4,
together with CLEAN maps of the first LOFAR observation of a solar eclipse and an in-
terpretation of the small-scale structure identified. Chapter 5 contains the conclusions
and Chapter 6 discusses the next steps of this PhD.Declaration

Introduction
1.1
The Sun
The Sun, our closest star, the centre of our solar system and a highly dynamic ball of plasma has
fascinated physicists and astronomers for centuries. Violent solar storms can regularly be observed
on Earth most notably as aurorae or disruptions to telecommunications and power grids. With so
many modern advancements in technology being satellite dependent, the importance and necessity
of solar physics research comes into focus.
The Sun, with a mass of 1.9889 ± 0.0003 × 10 30 kg, makes up over 99% of all the mass in our
solar system. It is a main sequence G-type star, also known as a “yellow dwarf”, with a luminosity
of 3.84 ± 0.04 × 10 26 W and radius of 6.959 ± 0.007 × 10 8 m (Foukal, 2004). Though a distance
of 1.49 × 10 11 m, much of the Sun’s activity can very much be detected here on Earth. This
activity is powered by a nuclear fusion chain reaction at the solar core. The reaction is a result of
the Sun’s formation when a large rotating cloud of gas and dust underwent gravitational collapse.
The proton-proton chain reaction occurs at the 15 MK core, (Foukal, 2004). The energy produced
is transfered from the edge of the core outwards by radiation and then to the solar surface via
convection.
Fig. 1.1 shows that the atmosphere, like the interior, is divided up into three regions; the
photosphere, the chromosphere and the corona. The photosphere, or solar surface, is the lowest
layer of the solar atmospheres and begins where the material becomes optically thin to visible
wavelengths (400 – 700 nm). It has an effective temperature of ∼5800 K. The chromosphere
begins at ∼400 km above the photosphere with temperatures of the order of 10 4 –10 5 K, (Gabriel,
1976; Vernazza et al., 1976, 1981). The third and final layer of atmosphere is called the corona
Figure 1.1: Schematic of the Sun, its interior and atmospheres. There are three main layers of solar inte-
rior; the core, the radiative zone, the convection zone. There are also three main layers of atmosphere; the
photosphere, the chromosphere, (the transition region,) and the corona. Image Credit: Universe Today
11.1 The Sun
which will now be discussed in more detail in Section 1.1.1
1.1.1
The Solar Corona
The corona is the outermost layer of the solar atmosphere, beginning at approximately 2500 km
(0.004 R  ) above the solar surface, at what is known as the transition region, and extending to
several R  . The coronal electron number density varies radially between 10 8 –10 9 (quiet sun or
active region) at the base of the corona to 10 5 –10 6 cm −3 at 1 R  , (Aschwanden, 2006). These
densities are constrained in a number of different ways, observationally via white-light polarised
brightness measurements, detection of radio bursts, as well as emission measure calculations made
from EUV and X-ray observations. Models such as that of Gabriel (1976) have used magnetic flux
concentrations to evaluate the electron density across the transition region and into the corona,
Fig. 1.2.
Fig. 1.2 also shows a sharp change in temperature from chromosphere (<10 4 K) to corona
(>10 6 K). These high coronal temperatures remain poorly understood. They appear to violate the
second law of thermodynamics as the Sun’s surface is known to have a much lower temperature of
∼5800 K. This implies that heat would have to be transfered from the photosphere to corona by
non-thermal processes. UV and radio observations show that further out, coronal temperatures
drop to <10 5 K at distances greater than 1R  , (Bastian et al., 1999).
Figure 1.2: Solid and dashed curve are the change in number density (cm −3 ) and temperature (K) respectively
in the upper chromosphere and lower corona. n e is electron density and n H 0 is neutral hydrogen density. Here
the chromospheric model of Fontenla et al. (1990) is based on ion abundance measurements from EUV lines,
constrained ambipolar diffusion. The lower corona is determined by the Gabriel (1976) 2-D model of solar flux
concentrations. The sharp decrease in density and increase in temperature demarcates the transition region
from chromosphere to corona. Image Credit: Aschwanden (2004)
However, it should be noted that Fig. 1.2 represents a simplified version of coronal behaviour.
21.1 The Sun
In fact, the solar corona is highly inhomogeneous in both density and temperature. Heating of
plasma via dynamic processes in the underlying chromosphere causes an upward pressure, produc-
ing structures that greatly exceed the density of the surrounding quiet Sun corona. The magnetic
pressure is far greater than the thermal pressure resulting in plasma flows along magnetic field
lines in the form of coronal loops.
EUV and soft X-ray observations are the primary source of information for these over-dense
structures in the lower corona. Instruments such as SOHO’s EIT 1 and GOES’s XRS 2 are sensitive
to wavelengths corresponding to emission from highly ionised species of elements in the very low
corona.
Visible wavelengths are used to probe above 0.3 R  , colloquially known as the ‘white-light’
corona. White-light observations are made during solar eclipses or instead with the use of a
coronograph. The optical corona is classified according to the scattering mechanism. L-corona or
E-corona (emission line corona)’s spectrum consists of emission lines produces by highly ionised
atoms and is present in the very low corona, <0.5 R  .
The K-corona (Kontinuierlich corona or ‘continuous’ corona) is dominated by Thomson scatter-
ing, the scattering of photospheric photons off free electrons. It extends up to 4 R  . The spectrum
of the K-corona is similar to that of the photosphere but lacks Fraunhofer lines due to thermal
Doppler broadening of light scattering off high velocity electrons.
The F-corona is caused by Mie or Rayleigh scattering whereby the light is scattered off inter-
planetary grains of dust. Unlike the K-corona, in the spectrum of the F-corona the Fraunhofer
lines are present as the dust grains travel at much slower velocities than the electrons responsible
for Thomson scattering. The F-corona (Fraunhofer corona) extends from 4 R  into interplanetary
space, beyond Earth.
The lower corona is well observed in EUV, X-ray and white-light but in order to examine the
structure and features of the mid to upper parts of the corona radio wavelengths must be used.
The work presented in this report focuses on the frequency range 120–180 MHz. Different coronal
density models, such as Allen (1947); Newkirk Jr (1961); Saito et al. (1977), can be used to estimate
the height in the corona from which this emission originates. The heights in this frequency range
exceed those shown in Fig. 1.2, however, one would expect the trend of decreasing density with
increasing height (10 7 – 10 8 cm −3 between 1 and 2 R  ). This has been shown observationally by
the likes of Morosan et al. (2014) and McCauley et al. (2017). It should also be noted that electron
density is typically higher for solar active regions (Gallagher et al., 1999) and lower above coronal
holes (Fludra et al., 1999).

31.2 The Radio Sun

1.2.1
The Radio Sun
Low Frequency Radio Observations
Solar radio astronomy can be broadly sub-divided according to the frequency range and therefore
the part of the solar atmosphere being probed. The GHz frequency range is used to examine
features of the lower corona, below 0.5 R  , whereas the the MHz frequency (“low frequency radio”)
is capable of studying coronal structure beyond 0.5 R  , which this report will focus on. (The kHz
frequency range is also useful to solar physicists and heliophysicists alike, to better understand the
interaction of solar activity with interplanetary space.)
One of the most interesting, open-ended questions in low-frequency solar radio astronomy
remains, what is the size of the smallest source of compact radio emission from the Sun? As radio
waves travel through the corona they are subject to scattering off electrons as well as refraction
due to changing electron density and refractive index (Erickson, 1964). This results in apparent
angular broadening of the radio sources which is directly related to coronal density turbulence and
inhomogeneities. To date there has been much research into the effect of scattering in the corona
on the size, location and intensity of observed radio emission (Fokker, 1965; Riddle, 1974; Steinberg
et al., 1971). Most recently, Kontar et al. (2017) used Tied-Array Imaging 1 to image sub-structure
of a Type III radio burst at 43MHz. From the dynamic spectra the source was predicted to be
of the order of 0.1 ' but the imaging yielded results of approximately 20 ' which was deemed a
product of coronal scattering. However, interferometric imaging can be used to achieve a much
finer angular resolution and therefore gain a better understanding of the extent of scattering.
Interferometric imaging is essentially the combination of many antennae or radio telescopes to
achieve a superior angular resolution and sensitivity than possible with a single dish (discussed in
more detail in Section 1.3). Solar radio interferometric imaging in the metric frequency range is
ongoing, making use of interferometers build in the 1960s, e.g. Culgoora Radioheliograph (Labrum,
1972), Nancay Radioheliograph (Kerdraon & Delouis, 1997). However, the drive for improved
resolution and sensitivity has encouraged the use of larger arrays spread across several hundreds
of kilometres. Recent imaging studies include McCauley et al. (2017) with MWA (Murchison
Widefield Array) and Breitling et al. (2015); Vocks et al. (2018) with LOFAR (LOw Frequency
ARray).
It was thought until recently that solar interferometric observations with baselines greater than
3 km were obsolete due to a ∼3 ' limit on angular resolution caused by propagation effects such
as scattering (Bastian, 2004). However, studies such as Mugundhan et al. (2018) have shown that
with baselines of ∼100s km it is possible to achieve resolution less than 15 '' for MHz observations.
Accordingly, by using longer baselines with instruments such as LOFAR and MWA small-scale
source detection is expected to improve.
1
Tied-Array Imaging uses beamformed observations to map an array of beams, each with its own dynamic
spectra, onto the Sun. The angular resolution is therefore limited by the size of the tied-array beam.
41.2 The Radio Sun
Another area of active research in the search for small-scale source emission is the use of solar
eclipse observations. During a solar eclipse the limb of the moon acts as a knife edge and sets
up a diffraction pattern. The angular resolution, θ, is equivalent to the first zone of the Fresnel
diffraction pattern which improves on what is possible via classic interferometry,
r
θ = 2 × 10 5
λ
arcsec
2D
(1.1)
where D is the distance between the Moon and Earth (3.8 × 10 8 m) and λ is the wavelength. This
technique has been used in the GHz (Gary & Hurford, 1987; Letfus et al., 1967) and MHz (Ramesh
et al., 2011) frequency ranges alike to resolve arcminute and sub-arcminute structure. Most relevant
to this work, Kathiravan et al. (2011) reported the observation of a source approximately 15 '' in
angular size from where 170 MHz emission originated.
1.2.2
Solar Radio Emission
In order to interpret solar radio observations correctly it is important to understand radio emission
processes, their relationship with frequency, temperature and height of the source of emission.
A blackbody is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings. According to Planck’s
Law a blackbody’s spectral radiance, B ν (T ), can be written as,
B ν (T ) =
1
2hν 3
hν
2
c e kT − 1
(1.2)
h is Planck’s constant (6.63 × 10 −34 Js), ν is frequency, c is the speed of light, k is the Boltzmann
constant (1.38 × 10 −23 JK −1 ) and T is temperature. In the radio frequency regime bodies radiate
very low energy photons. This means that the Rayleigh-Jeans limit (hν << kT ) can be applied
and the following simplification can be made,
2kT ν 2
B ν (T ) =
c 2
(1.3)
Spectral radiance is equivalent to the monochromatic intensity (I ν ) of a blackbody, i.e. is the
amount of radiation from a surface per unit frequency. I ν has the units Jm −2 s −1 Hz −1 sr −1 . It can
be integrated over all frequencies to find the surface brightness, also known as the total intensity,
Z
I =
I ν dν
[Jm −2 s −1 sr −1 ]
(1.4)
I ν can be integrated over a solid angle to find the flux. The flux is essentially the power emitted
per unit area (Wm −2 ).

However, the flux density which is most commonly used to describe radio observations of astro-
nomical bodies. This is the monochromatic intensity, integrated over a solid angle.

F ν =
I ν dΩ
[Jm −2 s −1 Hz −1 ]
(1.6)
The Jansky (Jy), the name given to the unit of flux density, is called after Karl Jansky who was
a radio astronomer and the first person to discover that radio waves were being emitted from the
Milky Way. 1 Jy is equivalent to 10 −26 Wm −2 Hz −1 . Solar radio astronomers have another unit to
measure the Sun’s flux density, the solar flux unit or sfu. 1 sfu is equal to 10 4 Jy.
Eq. 1.3 can be rearranged to solve for temperature of a blackbody, T bb ,
B ν (T )c 2
T bb =
2kν 2
(1.7)
Similarly, we can solve for T b , the brightness temperature, and T ef f , the effective temperature.
I ν (T )c 2
2kν 2
S ν (T )c 2
=
2kν 2
T b =
T ef f
(1.8)
(1.9)
T b is the temperature a blackbody in equilibrium would need in order to have the same intensity
as the observed emitting body. T ef f is the temperature a blackbody would have in order to emit
the same amount of electromagnetic radiation. To understand better the relationship between T b
and T ef f we must first inspect the equation for radiative transfer by considering an emission path
within a cloud of plasma,
dI ν
= j ν − κ ν I ν
dl
(1.10)
j ν is emissivity per unit volume, κ ν is the absorption coefficient and dl the change in length
corresponding to an increment in volume through which the radiation travels to produce a dI ν
change in intensity. The integral of κ ν can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless quantity called
optical depth, τ ν .
Z
τ ν =
κ ν dl → dτ ν = κ ν dl
(1.11)
Multiplying across Eq. 1.10 by 1/κ ν and substituting dτ ν for κ ν dl gives,

(1.13)1.2 The Radio Sun
Eq. 1.13 is a first order differential equation which (for a homogeneous source, i.e. no variation
along ray path) has a solution in the form of,
I ν = I o e −τ ν +
j ν
(1 − e −τ ν )
κ ν
(1.14)
Here the first term represents the external source of emission and the second term deals with the
sources of absorption and emission internal to the cloud of plasma. Using the Rayleigh-Jeans
approximation as abover, expressions for I ν , I o and κ j ν ν can be sunstitued into Eq. 1.14,

T b = T o e −τ ν + T e (1 − e −τ ν )
(1.15)
(1.16)
T b is the brightness temperature as before, T o is the temperature of the background and T e is the
electron temperature of the cloud of plasma. This assumes thermodynamic equilibrium and is
valid for a thermal source. This can be modified for a non-thermal source. According to Kirchoff’s
Law, κ j ν ν can be rewritten as S ν . This can be substitued into Eq. 1.14 and written in terms of T b
and T ef f .
T b = T o e −τ ν + T ef f (1 − e −τ ν )
(1.17)
Considering optical depth, τ ν , we can simplify Eq. 1.17 further. In the optically thick regime,
τ ν >> 1, T b is equivalent to T ef f . Whereas for an optically thin source, τ ν << 1, T b becomes
T o (1 − τ ν ) + τ ν T ef f . When we consider the case of an optically thin source with no background T b
can be written as τ ν T ef f .
The Sun is an emitter throughout the entire radio spectrum from micrometre to decimetre
to several decametre wavelengths. The top curve in Fig. 1.3 delineates the dominant emission
mechanism at each frequency, which for metre wavelengths/MHz frequencies is a combination
of coherent plasma emission and (predominantly for the quiet Sun) incoherent Bremsstrahlung.
Bremsstrahlung (“braking” radiation) is emission caused by the acceleration of electrons. This
encompasses all incoherent emission mechanisms including gyroemission and Compton scattering.
However, the term Bremsstrahlung is most commonly used to refer to acceleration of electrons due
to distant interactions with ions. Fig. 1.3 also shows the height of the emission at each frequency
which can be calculated via the free-free (Bremsstrahlung) absorption coefficient, κ f f .

n e is the electron density, ν is frequency and T is temperature. From Eq. 1.18 it is possible to
determine the height at which the metric radiation escapes the corona. Material with a higher
electron density absorbs radiation of lower frequencies. Therefore metre wavelength radiation

escapes from higher up in the corona (>0.5 R  ) whereas milli-metre and micro-metre emission is
produced much lower down in the corona (<0.5 R  ). Knowing at what height the atmosphere
becomes optically thin to certain frequencies allows for the probing of that layer’s temperature
using the relations derived above.

1.3 Interferometric Imaging
1.3.1 What is an Interferometer?
When performing imaging; no matter whether it is with a telescope, microscope or camera, one
of the most important parameters is achieving the best possible angular resolution. The angular
or spatial resolution of an instrument refers to its ability to distinguish between two objects, or
parts of the one object, separated by some small angular distance. The resolution of a system
is predominantly limited by diffraction effects. Rayleigh’s Criterion states that that in order to
resolve two point sources the diffraction maximum of one source must coincide with the diffraction
minimum of the other. Angular resolution can be represented as,
θ ∼
λ
D
(1.19)
where θ is the angular resolution in radians, λ is the wavelength of the radiation and D is the
instrument aperture diameter. Examining Eq. 1.19, it is clear that both the wavelength and
aperture diameter have influence on the resulting angular diameter, i.e. using shorter wavelengths
and larger diameters produces a better (smaller) angular resolution. However, in order to observe
in the radio regime of the electromagnetic spectrum the wavelength must be fixed in the order
of metres. This has lead to the development of many radio telescopes with large diameters in
order to achieve angular resolutions comparable with instruments operating in other parts of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Telescopes such as Arecibo with diameters of ∼305 m are pushing the
boundaries of what is possible with a single dish telescope. The limitations on angular resolution
imposed by dish diameter have lead to the development of a very different type of radio telescope,
namely an interferometer. Instead of building a telescope with a large diameter, two smaller
telescopes can be placed a distance apart in order to achieve the same desired angular resolution.
θ ∼
λ
B
(1.20)
where θ is the angular resolution in radians, λ is the wavelength of the radiation and B is the
baseline or distance between telescopes. This technique has been extended to “interferometric
arrays”, which are essentially numbers of smaller antennae that are spread across large distances
so that angular resolutions in the order of arcseconds can be attained. Such interferometric arrays
include the MWA (Murchison Widefield Array; Tingay et al. (2013)), LWA (Long Wavelength
Array; Ellingson et al. (2009)), LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray; Van Haarlem et al. (2013)) and,
in development, SKA (Square Kilometer Array; Dewdney et al. (2009)).
When discussing interferometric imaging it is often simpler to first consider a two-element
interferometer, which consists of two antennae and a single baseline between them (Fig. 1.4),
observing over a narrow frequency range. If a plane wave was incident from directly above, the

The output voltages from antenna 1 and antenna 2 are labeled v 1 and v 2 1 . The output voltage
of antenna 2, which receives the signal first, is written as v 2 = v cos (ωt). Antenna 1 has an output
voltage of v 1 = v cos (ωt − ωτ g ). The response, R, of the entire system is the correlation of the two

This correlation is projecting a cosinusoidal fringe pattern onto the sky. It multiplies the source
brightness by this interference pattern and sums across the sky. This is known as the “cosine”
component as the fringe pattern is even. The odd or “sine” component can be attained by in-
troducing a 90 o phase shift in the path of one of the antennae and repeating the analysis. The
cosine and sine correlations can be combined using Euler’s Theorem to give a complex exponential.
The point-source response function, R, can be rewritten as a “complex visibility” for an extended
source (the sum over many point-source response functions), V 1 .

The visibility function, V , is equal to the Fourier Transform of the source brightness distribution.
This can be expressed as a function of the (u, v, w) coordinate system. u, v and w are used to define

the position of b , the baseline vector. Each axis is orthogonal with w pointing in the direction of
the observed source. The source itself also has a set of coordinates to describe its position on sky
represented by the letters l, m, n. By setting w to zero, the visibility function can be expressed in
terms of the 2D Fourier transform of the sky brightness distribution,

V (u, v) =
I(l, m)e −i2π(ul+vm) dl dm (1.26)
V (u, v) = F[I(l, m)] (1.27)

Similar to Eq. 1.27, the brightness distribution can be written as the inverse Fourier Transform of
the visibility function,

Note: Upper case V is the complex visibility function and lower case v is the antenna voltage.
111.3 Interferometric Imaging
1.3.2
Making a Dirty Map
For every point on the sky there is a visibility function, V (u, v), whose inverse Fourier Transform
corresponds to a true brightness distribution, I(l, m). However, when using a radio telescope to
measure I(l, m) one is not measuring the continuous V (u, v). Instead, there is a series of antennae
with known baselines between them which results in only a subset of points being measured. This
is dictated by the sampling function or “u, v coverage”, S(u, v). Therefore, what is detected by an
interferometer is not the continuous visibility but in fact a sampled visibility function. This is the
product of S(u, v) and V (u, v).
SV(u, v) = S(u, v) · V (u, v)
(1.30)
By taking the inverse Fourier Transform of SV(u, v) (what is a measured) we are left with what is
known as a “dirty map”, I dirty .
I dirty = F −1 [S(u, v) · V (u, v)]
(1.31)
The Convolution Theorem states that the inverse Fourier Transform of the product of two functions
is equivalent to the convolution (*) of the inverse Fourier Transform of the two functions which
allows for I dirty to be rewritten as,
I dirty = F −1 [S(u, v)] ∗ F −1 [V (u, v)]
(1.32)
As shown in Eq. 1.29 the inverse Fourier Transform of the visibilities is equal to the brightness
distribution. The inverse Fourier Transform of the sampling function is written as B(l, m). B(l, m)
is known as the “synthesised beam” or beam pattern or point spread function (PSF), and is specific
to the instrument being used. Therefore I dirty can be written as the convolution of the beam pattern
and the true source brightness 1 ,
I dirty = B(l, m) ∗ I(l, m)
(1.33)
In order to determine a “true map” of source brightness a deconvolution must be performed.
1.3.3
Deconvolution
When producing a dirty map the measured sampled visibility function is first divided up into a
grid, whereby the inverse Fourier Transform can then be performed on each individual cell of the
grid separately. (Gridding and weighting schemes will be discussed in more detail in Section 3.3.1.)
It was discussed above that, though V (u, v) is continuous throughout the sky, only discrete mea-
1
A visual representation of the relationship between dirty map and sampled visibility is provided in, Fig. A.1.
121.3 Interferometric Imaging
surements of V (u, v) can be made according to the sampling function. In this case, a regular
gridding of the sampled visibility results in a number of the cells having no u, v information. It is
the aim of deconvolution to restore u, v information to these unmeasured points.
One of the main methods of image reconstruction or deconvolution is the use of the CLEAN
algorithm (Högbom, 1974). In this work all images have been produced using CLEAN or a variant
of CLEAN (i.e. CASA’s MS-MFS CLEAN, Rau & Cornwell (2011)). The CLEAN algorithm is
based on the idea of extracting the visibility components from the dirty map and convolving these
with a “CLEAN beam” which has complete u, v coverage.
First the pixel with peak intensity is located in the dirty map. Secondly, this intensity is
multiplied by the dirty beam pattern and a specified gain. The product is then subtracted from
the dirty map leaving behind what is known as “the residuals”. This process is repeated for the
next brightest pixel and so on until a particular threshold is reached or until the residuals are akin
to noise. What is subtracted from the Dirty Map is known as the point source model. The model
is convolved with a “CLEAN beam”. The residuals are then added to this convolution to create a
“CLEAN map”.
There are a number of different CLEAN algorithms which can be used in image restoration each
with its own advantages and disadvantages specific to particular imaging challenges. In the case
of the Sun which has a large amount of extended emission, the classic CLEAN algorithm which
uses a point source model is not the most efficient. Instead, Multi-Scale CLEAN represents the
source as a combination of extended structures of different scales, (Cornwell, 2008). Multi-Scale
CLEAN performs peak brightness subtraction on a series of images simultaneously, corresponding
to each of the specified scale sizes. The model from each scale is convolved with the appropriate
clean beam and added to the final residual image.

Instrumentation
2.1
LOw Frequency ARray
LOFAR or LOw Frequency ARray is a low-frequency radio interferometer led by ASTRON, the
Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. LOFAR is comprised of thousands of antenna divided
up into stations, centred around Exloo in the Netherlands, extending over a baseline of ∼2000km.
There are 24 stations that combine to form what is known as LOFAR’s core, an additional 14
remote stations throughout the Netherlands and 13 international stations across Europe. The core,
remote and international stations each have a unique design but all are made up of a combination
of LBA 1 (Low Band Antennae, 10 – 90 MHz) and HBA (High Band Antennae, 110 – 240 MHz),
Van Haarlem et al. (2013). The analysis detailed in this report uses the HBA of the core stations
which are indicated with an arrow in Fig. 2.1.
The HBA are constructed as 5m x 5m tiles (image provided in appendix, Fig. A.2). Inside,
a styrofoam structure holds in place 16 (4 x 4) dipole elements. Each element contains 4 bow-
tie (dual-polarised) antennae which are connected to pre-amplifiers. Each of the 16 dipole units
has two coaxial cables that connect to the tile’s summator from which two cables connect to the
receiver units inside the station container. The HBA sit on a metal ground plane or reflector. HBA,
unlike LBA, are not sensitive to the full sky. Instead, in order to point, analogue beamforming is
performed for each tile which is followed by digital beamforming in the station container.

Observations & Data Analysis
3.1
Solar Eclipse 20 March 2015
On the 20 March 2015 a partial solar eclipse (>80% totality) was observed as part of a 5-hour
LOFAR observing campaign that was carried out between 07:20 UT and 12:00 UT. The Sun was
experiencing a period of medium solar activity due to the presence of 2 βγ active regions (NOAA
12297, 12302), 2 β active regions (NOAA 12299, 12304) and an α active region (NOAA 12303) 1 .
Interestingly, the most apparent source of radio emission (as shown in ??) seems to be associated
with NOAA 12303. A number of C-class flares 2 occurred prior to the eclipse, most notably a C7.9
at 00:58 UT (plot provided in Fig. A.4). This was accompanied later by a partial halo CME at
01:05 UT. An image of the expanding CME at 03:24 UT is provided in Fig. 3.1b. Fig. 3.1a is a
multi-wavelength insight into the solar conditions at the time. The inner image has a set of grey
radio contours which trace out the emission of the PROBA 2/SWAP EUV image.

An α classification corresponds to a unipolar sunspot group. A β classification is a bipolar sunspot group
with a clear division between polarities. A γ classification is a sunspot group with positive and negative polarities
irregularly distributed. A βγ classification is a bipolar sunspot group with an irregular clear division between
polarities. These, along with other more complex classifications, follow Hale’s magnetic classification for sunspots
(Hale et al., 1919)

The flare classification system is denoted by letters; A, B, C, M, X, and is based on the peak flux of x-rays
in watts per square metre where each letter represents an increase in flux. C-class flares have a peak flux between
10 −6 and 10 −5 Wm −2 . The suffix following the letter denotes the factor by which the flux strength of the first of
the class should be multiplied.
153.2 Data Analysis
This observation was made with Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) using the HBA antennae
from 23 of LOFAR’s core stations, plotted in Fig. 3.2a, which gives a maximum baseline of >3.5km
and a minimum baseline of <45m. These stations combine to result in correlated raw visibilities for
253 baselines. The baselines can be converted to u, v coordinates, expressed in terms of wavelengths
and plotted to give the corresponding u, v coverage, Fig. 3.2b.
This 5-hour observation was made using LOFAR’s interferometric mode which provides a tem-
poral resolution of 1s and spectral resolution of 12.207kHz, (Van Haarlem et al., 2013). Mea-
surements were taken for a series of subbands every 10 MHz between 120 MHz and 180 MHz.
These were integrated over 5.5 seconds in order to increase signal-to-noise (during pre-processing).
Fig. 3.2c illustrates how the expected beamwidth (product of the tapering factor and full-width
half maximum) ranges between 1.2 ° and 2 ° for our chosen frequency range.
3.2
Data Analysis
The following section, Section 3.2 Data Analysis, follows the steps laid out in the block diagram
provided in the appendix Fig. A.5. The first task in the analysis of this data was to produce dirty
maps of the entire solar eclipse. This procedure was divided into two steps; pre-processing and
post-processing of the data.
The raw data from LOFAR’s Long Term Archive is in the form of “raw” measurement sets which
are a series of directories containing tables of metadata as well as u, v visibilities. Raw measurement
sets are extremely large (10s of terabytes) and therefore very difficult to work with. For this reason
we used DPPP (Default Pre-Processing Pipeline) developed by van Diepen & Dijkema (2018) for
LOFAR interferometric data. The data was moved to CEP 3, LOFAR’s central processing facility,
where it was averaged in time and frequency. DPPP is also capable of performing flagging for radio
frequency interference (RFI). This was not applied as automated RFI flaggers are susceptible to
flagging solar radio bursts and even sometimes quiet solar emission.
The second step, the post-processing, was done using a powerful radio astronomy software
called CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications, McMullin et al. (2007)). CASA was
developed by an international consortium of radio astronomers as a tool to handle both single
dish and interferometric data with a Python-like interface. After DPPP, the measurement sets are
“CASA-ready”. The data was manually inspected and flagged for RFI or malfunctioning antennae
using a CASA plotting tool, plotms.
As discussed in Section 1.3.2, a dirty map is made by taking the inverse Fourier Transform of
the sampled visibility function. This is done by modifying CASA’s clean algorithm to run with
zero iterations. The results can be seen in Fig. 3.3. These images are uncalibrated and yet to
undergo deconvolution. Nevertheless, the Moon can be seen clearly transiting the disk of the Sun.

points on the u, v plane represent a baseline at a certain
frequency. The number of baselines can be calculated

the array.

MHz. This is calculated from 0.8(λ/B) where 0.8 is de-
pendent upon both the configuration of the antenna ar-
ray as well as the weighting scheme used. Van Haarlem
et al. (2013) states that 0.8 is suitable for a more uniform
weighting scheme which is very similar to that used in this
work (Briggs with robustness -2).

SIN-projected coordinate system; right ascension on the x-axis and declination on the y-axis. SIN-Projection
(slant orthographic) is commonly used in radio aperture synthesis whereas TAN-projection (gnomonic) is
commonly used in optical astronmy. Calabretta & Greisen (2002) explains that points on the celestial sphere
are projected onto a tangential plane. TAN projected points are found by extending a line from the celestial
sphere cente through the points on the sphere surface to intersect with the plane. SIN projected points
are found by moving perpendicularly outwards from the sphere surface until intersecting with the tangential
plane. (A movie of the dirty maps throughout the observation for the the 3 multi-frequency bands is provided,

3.2.1
Calibration
The first step to produce a CLEAN map is the calibration of the data. This is necessary to
correct for instrumental and atmospheric effects that may corrupt measurements of an object’s
true visibility.
V ij observed (ν, t) = G ij (t)B ij (ν, t)V ij true (ν, t)
(3.1)
ij represents a pair of antennae, i.e. a single baseline. G ij is the antenna gain or complex “contin-
uum” gain and can be split into two terms, the amplitude and phase. B ij is the “bandpass gain”.
Bandpass calibration is necessary to correct for how phase and amplitude vary with frequency.
Bandpass gain also has a very slow time dependency (which in this case has been omitted due
to the use of static bandpass calibration). Therefore in order to get V ij observed as close as possible
to the true visibility a set of solutions need to be derived so that the difference between observed
and true is minimised. The true visibilities of a source are predicted using a model specific to
the instrument being used. These model visibilities are subtracted from the observed visibilities
and from this a set of equations can be generated which relate the calibration parameters to the
difference between observed and predicted visibilities. This is done for a “calibrator” which is a
183.2 Data Analysis
bright source with a very well-known visibility model. The calibration parameters calculated using
this calibrator can then be applied to the target.
For this observation we used a 20 minute observation of Cygnus A prior to the eclipse as a
bandpass calibrator. (Ideally, an observation of the calibrator before and after or intermittently
during an observation to ensure atmospheric conditions have not changed is preferable and hence
this observation could not be used for complex gain calibration.) For this observation a set of
static bandpass calibration tables were generated as the calibrator and eclipse were not observed
at the same time. They were made by Michiel Brentjens. The calibration tables were applied to
the observations of the eclipse through the use of CASA’s applycal.
A procedure called self-calibration (self-cal) was implemented. This is essentially using your
source to better calibrate the complex gains as a function of time. As explained above a good
model of your source is needed to calibrate it. Self-cal instead uses the model generated after each
iteration of CLEAN to solve for the complex gain solutions.
First the initial bandpass calibration is applied to the observed visibilities and a CLEAN map
is produced. The CLEANed model can then be compared to the original data and a set of phase
calibrations applied. The data is CLEANed again producing a better model of the visibilities than
before. For each iteration of self-cal the solutions for phase can be plotted for the observation
period per antenna. The points will scatter above and below 0 degrees phase (not necessarily
centred at 0 degrees for each antenna). Another iteration of self-cal is performed. The scatter of
the phase solutions should reduce and centre around 0 degrees. The process is repeated again until
the scatter of phase solutions relative to the model phase do not change between self-cal iteration.
At this stage a joint amplitude and phase calibration 1 can be applied using the most recently
CLEANed image and corresponding source model. This is again repeated with deeper cleans until
the amplitude solutions no longer improve (similarly evaluated to phase solutions above) and a
good signal-to-noise is achieved.
3.2.2
CLEAN
The self-cal process discussed above in Section 3.2.1 was implemented using a phase-only calibra-
tion. This was paired with a multi-scale approach using the “Clark” CLEAN algorithm (Clark,
1980). The main benefit of the Clark algorithm is that it is faster than the standard Högbom
algorithm (Section 1.3.3). The two are very similar but the Clark deconvolution is split between
a series of major and minor cycles. During each minor cycle only the brightest pixels are located
and the convolution is done with a subset of the point spread function. During the major cycle the
clean components are removed simultaneously from the residual map in the Fourier domain. This
is then repeated. Clark CLEAN also has the added advantage of being able to search for peaks in
each of the Stokes I, Q, U, V maps and so is very useful for polarisation imaging. Section 3.3.3
1
For this work a phase-only self-calibration was applied as amplitude varies on a much longer time-scale and so
assumed to be unchanging during the observation. This is currently being investigated in ongoing imaging.
193.3 Testing CLEAN Parameters
will describe the application of the Clark algorithm to a Multi-Scale Multi-Frequency Synthesis
CLEAN.
3.3
Testing CLEAN Parameters
There are a number of different parameters in the CLEAN algorithm that can be modified to
optimise the deconvolution specific to the task at hand. We have performed an analysis of several
of these parameters, including weighting schemes, loop gain and the combination of frequencies. A
discussion of their significance and the process of investigation follows in Section 3.3.1, Section 3.3.2
and Section 3.3.3. In Chapter 4 we examine the results of this analysis.
3.3.1
Weighting Schemes
“Weighting schemes” are used to weight visibility data based on the sampling of the u, v plane.
Depending on the purpose of the imaging, weighting may be given to longer baselines which
emphasises smaller size-scale structure or alternatively to shorter baselines in order to highlight
diffuse, extended emission. In addition, certain weighting schemes may be chosen to lessen the
influence of under-sampled areas of the u, v plane.
Eq. 1.31 states that the dirty map is the inverse Fourier Transform of the product of the
sampling function, S(u, v) and the visibilities, V (u, v). When using a weighting scheme the dirty
map becomes the weighted average of the data,
I dirty =
F −1 [S(u, v) · V (u, v) · W (u, v)]
Σ u,v W (u, v)
(3.2)
where W (u, v), the weighting function, is equal to σ 1 2 · wt. σ is the standard deviation and wt is
the visibility weight which changes depending on the weighting scheme used.
As mentioned in Section 1.3.3, one can imagine the dirty map or u, v plane being divided into
a regular grid. Each cell of the grid contains u, v information related to the observation’s u, v
coverage. There are three main weighting schemes that utilise the distribution of u, v points to
determine the value given to wt.
Natural weighting assigns wt the value of 1. This means that the u, v points are evenly weighted
across the u, v plane no matter the sampling density. The individual u, v weights are then summed
to given an overall weight for a given cell in the grid. This can often result in more density
populated cells with shorter baselines having more weight than those that are sparsely populated.
This leads to a large PSF and poor spatial resolution but high signal-to-noise in the final image.
Uniform weighting sets wt to be ρ(u 1 i ,v i ) . Each u, v point is given a weighting that is inversely
proportional to the density of points in the i th cell. This results in cells with sparse u, v sampling
getting an equal weighting to those of high u, v sampling, essentially a “uniform” weighting across
203.3 Testing CLEAN Parameters
the u, v plane. Images with uniform weighting schemes have high spatial resolution but forgo good
signal-to-noise.
Briggs weighting is often considered a compromise between the two schemes detailed above.
wt is s·ρ(u i ,v 1 i )+σ i where s, σ i control the emphasis on signal or noise. Briggs weighting applies a
natural weighting where u, v sampling is low and a uniform weighting where u, v sampling is high.
Robustness is an adjustable parameter that controls how natural-like (+5) or uniform-like (-5)
the weighting scheme is. The measure of robustness has a power-law dependence with the weight
specific to a point in the u, v plane.
We tested each of the three weighting schemes mentioned above and examined the resulting
images (examples of which are provided in the appendix, Fig. A.6).
3.3.2
Gain
Gain, commonly known as loop gain, is another parameter that can be adjusted during the decon-
volution process. Gain essentially controls the steps size between CLEAN iterations as it is the
fraction of flux subtracted from the dirty map and added to the CLEAN model during each itera-
tion. Though using a lower gain results in longer computation time, it is often the better option.
A lower gain gives more control over the CLEAN process and can prevent “over-CLEANing” of
an image. The effect of gain variation on a CLEAN map is shown in Fig. 3.4. Here the gain is
changed incrementally between 0 and 1 while CLEAN is run for 20 iterations. From the figure,
the higher gain values result in a deeper clean.

0.1 and 20 iterations of CLEAN.

0.5 and 20 iterations of CLEAN.
(c) Solar image made with gain of
0.9 and 20 iterations of CLEAN.

different value for loop gain (0.1, 0.5, 0.9 from left to right) and undergone 20 iterations of CLEAN. The
images demonstrate how using a larger loop gain cleans more deeply during each iteration.

3.3.3
Multi-Frequency Synthesis
Another aspect of the deconvolution process examined as part of this work was the use of Multi-
Frequency Synthesis. As mentioned previously in Section 1.3.2, though the visibility function is
continuous across the sky, what is measured is a sampled visibility. This is a number of discrete
visibility measurements which correspond to the configuration of an antenna array and can be
written as follows,
SV(u, v) = S(u, v) · V (u, v)
(3.3)
where SV(u, v) is the sampled visibility function, S(u, v) is the sampling function (u, v coverage)
and V (u, v) is the visibility function. A u, v plane with more points (i.e. more baselines) results
in a truer representation of the sky’s continuous visibility function and therefore a higher fidelity
final CLEAN image. The effect of changing u, v coverage is shown in Fig. 3.5. As the number of
baselines increase from 2 to 56 the u, v coverage becomes more complete which leads to point spread
function (PSF) that approaches a 2 dimensional gaussian. This is explained by the relationship
between PSF and u, v coverage detailed in Section 1.3.2. The PSF or beam pattern, B(l, m), is
the inverse Fourier Transform of the sampling function, S(u, v).
From Fig. 3.5 it is clear that u, v coverage is restricted by the number and separation of
the antennae that can be built which often has financial and political limitations. A common
technique used to improve sparse u, v coverage without the construction of additional antennae
is Earth Rotation Synthesis (ERS). This involves the observation of a source over the course of
several hours. Due to the rotation of the Earth the u, v plane also rotates which leads to arcs
rather than points of u, v coverage. The effectiveness of the method is emphasised in Fig. 3.5d
which shows the disappearance of sidelobes in the associated beam pattern.
However, it often challenging to use ERS when observing the Sun. The Sun is an extended
source and highly dynamic. Its emission cannot be assumed to stay constant over the course of
hours. The unsuitability of ERS is even more pronounced for this particular observation as the
Moon transits the Sun resulting in a constantly varying source.
One possible solution is to revert back to Snapshot Imaging where short duration observations
are made with the reduced u, v coverage. This is common for solar imaging. Another possible
solution is the use of aforementioned Multi-Frequency Synthesis (MSF) which was originally spoken
about in the 1940s by the likes of McCready et al. (1947) and implemented later by Conway et al.
(1990) and Sault & Conway (1999). MSF is essentially the combination of different frequencies
to produce a multi-frequency image. A point on the u, v plane represents a projected baseline
measured in wavelengths. Consequently, for a particular baseline it is possible to have many points
on the u, v plane corresponding to different frequencies. For this work a frequency range of 120–180
MHz was divided into three separate multi-frequency bands; approximately 120–140 MHz, 140–160
MHz and 160–180 MHz. The u, v coverage for the upper and lower bands is plotted in Fig. 3.6.

Figure 3.5: The u, v coverage (left) and point spread function (right) for several different antenna configura-
tions. In Fig. 3.5a, Fig. 3.5b and Fig. 3.5c the number of antennae is doubling between each image. The number
of baselines scale as N(N-1) where N is the number of antennae. An increased number of baselines results in a
fuller u, v coverage which in turn leads to a PSF that approaches a 2 dimensional gaussian. Fig. 3.5d is the u, v
coverage for 8 antenna over the course of several hours, i.e. ERS. Instead of point in the u, v plane, there are
sweeping arcs. This has the effect of greatly suppressing the sidelobes in the PSF. Image Credit: Presentation
by Andrea Isella, Caltech CASA Radio Analysis Workshop, 2011.
Similar to Fig. 3.5d, the MFS u, v plane is more full than that of the single frequency snapshot
case as in Fig. 3.2b. Unlike ERS, the MSF forms lines in the u, v coverage rather than “arcs”.
Nevertheless, this allows for the production of a higher fidelity image without the introduction of
additional baselines or antennae.
In spite of its apparent advantage, caution must be taken when using MFS imaging. Conway
et al. (1990) states that frequency range should not exceed 10–15% either side of the central
frequency. This is to ensure that source structure does not change significantly throughout the
multi-frequency band. As discussed previously, the density at which solar radio emission occurs
is related to emission frequency. Therefore, it is important not to opt for an excessively large
frequency band in which much of the source scale information would be lost.
As mentioned previously in Section 1.3.3 when performing deconvolution for an extended source
an approach that is spatial-scale sensitive must be taken, e.g. Multi-Scale Clean (MS CLEAN).
Similarly, deconvolution is not as straightforward when performing MFS. There are a number of
different algorithms that have been developed to deal with MFS. For this work CASA’s MS-MFS
233.3 Testing CLEAN Parameters
CLEAN (Rau & Cornwell, 2011) was used. Similar to classic deconvolution where a model is
needed to describe the spatial structure of the sky, MSF deconvolution requires information about
the spectral structure of the sky. MS-MSF CLEAN models the sky brightness as a number of
components of different scales whose frequency amplitude follow a Taylor-polynomial. The result
of the deconvolution is three images (tt0, tt1, tt2) which are the three coefficients of the Taylor
expansion. The first is the intensity, the second the spectral index and the third the curvature. This
deconvolution is done as a series of minor cycle and major cycles according to Clark’s algorithm.

Results & Interpretation
4.1
CLEAN Maps of the Solar Eclipse
Following the procedure laid out in Section 3.2, we successfully produced CLEAN maps of the
entire 5 hour observation, the very first LOFAR observation of a solar eclipse. The observation
was divided into 5.5s integrations every 10 minutes throughout the 5 hours. Each image was
manually flagged, bandpass calibrated and was subject to phase-only self-calibration (discussed in
Section 3.2.1) paired with a Clark Multi-Scale CLEAN algorithm (discussed in Section 3.2.2). Each
weighting scheme was tested during the imaging process. Briggs weighting with a robustness of -2
was found to be the most suitable as it provided the desired angular resolution while still outputting
an image with sufficient signal-to-noise. A low gain was used in each iteration of CLEAN to allow
for better control of the depth to which was CLEANed. These parameters were paired with a
MFS approach. The 120–180 MHz frequency range was sub-divided into 3 multi-frequency bands;
120–140 MHz, 140–160 MHz and 160–180 MHz.
CLEAN maps for the middle band, 140–160 MHz, are presented in Fig. 4.3. (The lower and
upper bands are provided in the appendix at Fig. A.8 and Fig. A.9. In addition, movies of the
eclipse for each of the three bands can be found at https://goo.gl/m2qYFD.) Here, we can see
four images that depict four different stages of the eclipse observation. In each image the visible
solar limb and lunar limb have been overplotted with a white, dashed circle and dark-blue, dashed
circle respectively. The first image, Fig. 4.3a, is an image of the quiet Sun at 07:45 UT, before the
eclipse. Fig. 4.3b, the second image, shows the Moon in ingress, i.e. the beginning of the eclipse.
The third in the series, Fig. 4.3c, is the image closest to the mid-point of the eclipse. This is not
totality as this was a partial eclipse of just over 80% 1 . Interestingly, this image appears to have
a mottled pattern that the others do not. On inspection of the images it was found that this
only happens when the bright emission at the north-east limb of the Sun (visible in Fig. 4.3d) is
eclipsed. One of the current theories to explain this effect is that this pattern is in fact due to
scattering of light off the irregular surface of Moon as described by Hagfors (1961) and Hagfors
et al. (1990). Research into this is currently ongoing. The final image, Fig. 4.3d, shows the egress
of the lunar transit.
From movies made of the eclipse (https://goo.gl/m2qYFD) the Sun can be seen to jump in
position slightly in the morning, pre-eclipse. This is not as apparent later on in the observation.
At first it was thought that this was a product of a poorly defined phase centre. However, the
lunar limb’s trajectory is steady and constant. This leads us to believe that the inconsistent source
position may be due to ionospheric instability. The effect of ionospheric turbulence is known to be
worse in the morning and evening as the light of the Sun has to travel through a thicker layer of
1
Side Note: A radio eclipse is always partial as the radio Sun appears larger than the visible Sun. This means
that the Moon never truly eclipses the entirety of the radio Sun. Ramesh et al. (2011).

Earth’s atmosphere. This may be improved with more iterations of self-cal, including a phase and
amplitude self-calibration, as the complex gain is subject to changes in the ionosphere.
As the observation continues the shapes of the sources of emission appear to change also,
from elongated to somewhat circular. This is an artifact of the the restoring beam used during
deconvolution. In this case the restoring beam was the PSF corresponding to the dirty map. As
explained in Section 1.3.2, the PSF is the inverse Fourier transform of the u, v plane. In the
morning of this observation the u, v plane is narrow and elongated, while closer to noon the u, v
plane approaches a circle. The PSF is provided in the bottom right-hand corner of each image as
a white ellipse. From Fig. 4.3 the PSF can be seen to change throughout the day in response to
the changing u, v plane.

UT LOFAR data from the 140–160 MHz band overlaid. The red line is the slice along which the intensity
profile is taken to determine source size in Section 4.1.1.
The strong source of emission mentioned previously at the north-east limb of the Sun in Fig. 4.3d
is actually present throughout the observation in the 140–160 MHz band, though at varying degrees
of intensity. This feature is also present in the upper 160–180 MHz band but not in the lower
frequency band. This may be a product of the diminishing spatial resolution at lower frequencies.
When we examine the composite image of Fig. 4.1, we find that the bright emission seems to be
associated with the active region NOAA 12303. Fig. 4.1 also reveals that the rest of the emission
seems to “zig-zag” between the coronal holes visible in the 193 Å image in Fig. 4.1a. The presence
of dark coronal hole features coincides with claims in the literature that there is a transition from
bright to dark features at 120 MHz when going from low to high frequencies (McCauley et al.,
2017). Interestingly, it could be argued that the most intense emission also avoids the active regions
visible on disk.
264.1 CLEAN Maps of the Solar Eclipse
4.1.1
Determining Small-Scale Structure
What can we learn from these CLEAN maps of the 2015 solar eclipse? There has been much
discussion as to what is the smallest source size that can be observed in the radio corona. As
mentioned in Section 1.2.1, it was believed that nothing smaller than an arcminute can be observed
in the MHz frequency range. We can therefore exploit this eclipse observation to investigate the
validity of these claims.
A preliminary investigation of source size was carried out by taking a slice across each CLEAN
map and plotting the intensity as a function of pixels. A gaussian was fit to each of the main peaks
along the slice and the FWHM was taken. From this, a first order approximation of the size of
each feature could be calculated. Provided is a CLEAN map of the 160–180 MHz band, Fig. 4.2a.
The red line is the slice along which the intensity in Fig. 4.2b is plotted. When this was repeated
for the other bands it was found that FWHM for the higher frequencies was smaller than for lower
frequencies as would be expected.
This is currently being repeated for smaller features other than the large region on the north-
east limb 1 . One possible route of inquiry is the examination of deviations to the gaussian fit. We
can examine these discrepancies and ask if these are a result of physical structure or indeed products
of image processing. This work is still ongoing. It will conclude with an analysis of the occultation
method and a comparison of the angular resolution achieved using classic interferometry to that
making use of the knife-edge effect.

Conclusions
To conclude, through the analysis of interferometric data from the 20 March 2015 we have
successfully produced CLEAN maps of a solar eclipse. This is the first solar eclipse observed by
LOFAR. Using these images we resolved source sizes of the order of arcminutes.
In the course of this study we have investigated the use of different CLEAN algorithms. As
this is a solar observation, a Multi-Scale CLEAN was used which is better suited to deconvolu-
tion of extended emission. The Clark algorithm was chosen as it performs deconvolution with a
combination of minor and major cycles making it more efficient than the Högbom algorithm. We
also investigated the effect of different CLEAN parameters on the deconvolution. We tested three
different weighting schemes; natural, uniform and briggs. Briggs with a robustness of -2 was found
to be optimum for our project’s objective, which was to produce images with highest possible
angular resolution. Briggs -2 provided this resolution while yielding a better signal-to-noise than
uniform weighting. The loop gain was also considered. It was found that the lowest gain gave
the most control over the deconvolution and avoided CLEANing images too deeply. A technique
called Multi-Frequency Synthesis was adopted to improve the poor u, v coverage, characteristic
of snapshot imaging. This was done by performing deconvolution on three concatenated 20 MHz
multi-frequency bands. 20 MHz was the chosen band-width as, at these frequencies, the corona is
not thought to change significantly throughout this range.
The above analysis resulted in a 5-hour series of CLEAN maps, one every 10 minutes, for each
of the three frequency ranges. Fig. 4.1 shows how the radio emission of the CLEAN map for
11:55 UT closely resembles that in the SDO/AIA 193Å EUV image. The constant presence of the
bright emission on the north-east limb associated with active region NOAA 12303 implies it is real
emission from the solar corona. The series of multi-frequency images provided the opportunity
to analyse how the size of this source changes with frequency and time. By taking a slice across
the bright emission in each frequency band the source size was shown to decrease with increasing
frequency, which is as expected from the expression for angular resolution, θ ∼ λ/B. Sources of
the order of several arcminutes were resolved. We continue to investigate smaller features in the
CLEAN maps but first must confirm they are physical and not an artifact of imaging. The next
task is to compare angular resolutions achievable via the lunar occultation technique to those of
this interferometric analysis.
Chapter 6 will address how the techniques learned and developed throughout this work will be
used in the future to fulfil the remaining work packages of this PhD.

Future Work
This chapter details the objectives for this PhD, outlines the work done thus far and details
the future work to be completed. The chapter concludes with a summary gantt chart illustrating
the timeline to complete this future work, Fig. 6.1.
As discussed in the opening Summary the goals of this PhD are divided up into three main
Work Packages. The first Work Package is the installation and operation of I-LOFAR, the Irish
station of the LOw Frequency ARray. From March until August of 2017 I was a leading member of
the team responsible for the planning and construction of I-LOFAR. As a member of the I-LOFAR
team I was jointly responsible for the installation, integration and testing of each component and
the station as a whole to ensure it was in line with international specifications. To do this I worked
with colleagues from ASTRON and AstroTec (IRC Enterprise Partner). Participating in the build
gave me an invaluable insight into LOFARs operations and gave me a greater understanding of
how the data is generated. Since then I have learned how to operate the telescope, perform
diagnostics and take scientific data that I will use in future research. To date I am part of the
I-LOFAR Observing Team and regularly use the station to observe the Sun during designated
observation periods. Observing with I-LOFAR and maintenance of the station remains one of my
responsibilities throughout my PhD.
The second Work Package of my PhD is the development of a pipeline to perform interferometric
imaging of the Sun. Thus far, this has been done through the analysis of an interferometric
observation of the solar eclipse of March 2015, presented in this report. Presently, we are refining
our imaging of this event exploring the use of a new CASA algorithm, tclean, in combination
with more iterations of self-calibration to ensure we have achieved the highest possible fidelity
image. We are investigating the small-scale structure revealed through the interferometric imaging
process. We intend to examine the relationship between source size and frequency to get a better
constraint on the effect of scattering at low frequencies. In the short-term, we will explore the
use of the lunar occultation technique to probe the small-scale structure using the best possible
angular resolution. A publication on this work is in preparation and will be submitted within
the next 3 months. This software will be subsequently benchmarked and tested thoroughly. This
will culminate in the writing and publishing of a technical paper describing the imaging pipeline
software capable of analysing high resolution imagery of the Sun at low frequencies.
Work Package Three is to apply the interferometric imaging software to other observations.
We intend to use LOFAR’s Long Term Archive (LTA) to search for previous interferometric solar
observations. We will also submit an observing proposal to use longer baselines. As mentioned in
Section 1.2.1 observations such as those by Mugundhan et al. (2018) motivate the use of longer
baselines to achieve sub-arcminute angular resolution. We will compile an analysis of small-scale
structure using different baselines throughout the entire LOFAR frequency range in order to better
understand the effects of scattering. This will conclude with a publication detailing the survey
which can be used in the future as a reference for those performing low frequency observations of
30the Sun.

Relationship between Dirty Map and
Sampled Visibility
Figure A.1: (a) Sky brightness distribution, I(l, m). (b) Beam pattern/PSF, B(l, m). (c) Dirty map or the
convolution of the sky brightness and synthesised beam. (d) The visibilities, V (u, v), which is the Fourier
transform of I(l, m). (e) The u, v coverage or sampling function, S(u, v), which is the Fourier transform of
B(l, m). (f) The sampled visibility (what is measured) which is the product of V (u, v) and S(u, v). By taking
the inverse Fourier Transform of this we retrieve the dirty map (image above). Image Credit: web.njit.edu/

Low Band Antenna - LBA
LBA are antenna that observe in the lower part of LOFAR’s frequency spectrum, between 10 MHz
and 90 MHz. Fig. A.2a is an image of a typical LBA found in each of the three types of LOFAR
station. The metal grate on the ground acts as a reflector or mirror for radio waves. The 1.7m
heavy-duty plastic pole at the centre of the grate serves as a conduit for two copper coaxial cables
that travel between the low noise amplifier (at the top of the pole) and the receiver units in the
electronics container. The two cables correspond to x and y polarisations. There are four inverted
v-shape dipole antennae that radiate from the amplifier at 90 o and are anchored at each corner of
the metal grate. Each of the dipoles has a length of 1.38m which gives the LBA a resonance peak
at 52 MHz which, because of the amplifier’s impedance, is shifted to 58 MHz (Fig. A.3a). The
LBA can observe the whole sky at the same time, therefore it is after observations that digital
beamforming is carried out.
34A.3 Spectra for I-LOFAR LBA and HBA
(a) Image of LBA antenna.
The metal ground
plane/mirror is the on the ground, the LNA is on top
of the plastic pole from which the four dipole antennae
are emanating. Image Credit: lofar.ie
(b) Interior of a HBA tile, zoomed in on one of the
dipole elements. One of the four bow-tie antennae can
be seen supported by the styrofoam (the rest hidden
from view). The pre-amplfier is in the centre, connected
to each of the antennae. The metal ground plane is
beneath the tile. Image Credit: lofar.ie

Spectra for I-LOFAR LBA and HBA
(a) A spectrum for one LBA at the Irish LOFAR
station, I-LOFAR. The resonance peak of the LBA
is shown at 58 MHz. There is also a number of Radio
Frequency Interference (RFI) most notedly below 20
MHz. Image Credit: Joe McCauley
(b) A spectrum for a single I-LOFAR HBA. The
spectrum is a lot flatter than that of the LBA but
there is a resonance peak ∼125MHz. The spectrum
has two prominent RFI peaks. Image Credit: Joe

Steps to produce a CLEAN Map
Figure A.5: Block Diagram to explain the steps to produce CLEAN maps. The process is divided into two
sections the pre-processing which uses DPPP and the post-processing which uses CASA. The individual steps
are given in blue boxes with adjoining red arrows. Underneath there is a brief explanation (black). Explanations
relating to self-calibration are written in red. The two products of the imaging process, dirty map and CLEAN
map, are in yellow boxes.

Comparison of Weighting Schemes
(a) Dirty map produced with natural weighting for a
multi-frequency band 115–185 MHz at 07:24 UT.
(b) Dirty map produced with uniform weighting for a
multi-frequency band 115–185 MHz at 07:24 UT.
(c) Dirty map produced with Briggs weighting for a
multi-frequency band 115–185 MHz at 07:24 UT.
Figure A.6: Dirty maps produced with each of three tested weighting schemes. Each image is of a multi-
frequency band 115–185 MHz at 07:24 UT, before the eclipse. The coordinate system is helioprojective. The
colourbar on the side refers to the intensity and is measured in Jansky per beam. Fig. A.6a shows that a
natural weighting results in a much reduced spatial resolution. Fig. A.6b is an image of uniform weighting and
has much finer angular resolution. Fig. A.6c, the Briggs weighting, has a similar resolution to Fig. A.6b but
an increased signal-to-noise (refer to coloubar).

a particular frequency. As the u, v plane is plotted in wavelength a single baseline can have several points if
numerous frequencies are included.
